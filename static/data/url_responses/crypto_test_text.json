The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said banks must be able to demonstrate they have appropriate risk management tools before taking on activities like providing custody services for customers' crypto holdings. \"Because many of these technologies and products present novel risks, banks must be able to demonstrate that they have appropriate risk management systems and controls in place to conduct them safely,\" said acting Comptroller Michael Hsu in a statement.\nThe new stance from the regulator places a higher bar on banks considering some crypto activities, after the agency under former President Donald Trump cleared the way for banks to engage in some crypto work. Under the new interpretive letter, banks are not allowed to engage in several crypto-related activities, such as providing custody for crypto assets and using dollar deposits and reserves to back \"stablecoins,\" without first notifying their bank supervisors of their intention to engage in that activity. Supervisors will then review the bank's risk management tools and systems, and allow the activity only if banks demonstrate they can do so in a safe and sound manner. A separate joint statement from the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the OCC issued on Tuesday said banking regulators intend to clarify in 2022 what role traditional banks can legally play in the cryptocurrency market.

MUMBAI, Nov 24 \u2014 India\u2019s government will introduce a bill to ban private cryptocurrencies and create a framework for a central bank-backed digital money, parliament said in a shock announcement late Tuesday. The proposed bill \u201cseeks to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India\u201d, the Lok Sabha said, and comes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned last week that Bitcoin presents a risk to younger generations and could \u201cspoil our youth\u201d if it ends up \u201cin the wrong hands\u201d. It is the latest such move by a major emerging economy, after China declared all cryptocurrency transactions illegal in September. India\u2019s crypto market has boomed since the country\u2019s Supreme Court overturned a previous ban in April last year, growing more than 600 per cent over the past year according to research by Chainalysis. Between 15 and 100 million people in Asia\u2019s third-largest economy are estimated to own cryptocurrencies, with total holdings in the billions of dollars. Their investments will now face an uncertain future. India\u2019s central bank announced in June that it is working to introduce its own digital currency by the end of the year, while warning it has \u201cserious concerns\u201d about private cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum and others. The bill, to come before the new legislative session, will allow for some exceptions to promote cryptocurrency technology, according to parliament\u2019s bulletin of upcoming business, but no further details about the proposed legislation were released. The market price of Bitcoin appeared unaffected and was up 1.67 per cent in Tuesday\u2019s trade.

Intellectual capital will move away, investors will face losses.\u201d Under scrutiny Cryptocurrencies have been under scrutiny by Indian regulators since first entering the local market in 2013. A surge in fraudulent crypto transactions following the Modi government\u2019s demonetisation of nearly all banknotes in 2016 led to the country\u2019s central bank banning crypto transactions in April 2018. The Supreme Court lifted the ban two years later and investments have surged in the time since. Indians have been bombarded in recent months with advertisements for CoinSwitchKuber, CoinDCX and other home-grown crypto exchanges across television channels, online streaming services and social media. These platforms spent more than 500 million rupees (RM28.1 million) on advertising spots during the recently concluded T20 cricket World Cup, research by TAM Sports showed, with viewers subjected to an average of 51 cryptocurrency advertisements per match. Analysts say regulation would be central to addressing security risks, with crypto exchanges increasingly targeted by cyber criminals as virtual currency prices soar. \u2014 AFP Loading... \u00a9 2021, Malay Mail, All Rights Reserved.",

Authorities said that the government will only be allowing specific cryptocurrencies to promote their underlying technology and uses based on a legislative agenda for the winter session that is set to start later this month. The bill is known as the Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021. Officials are also looking to use the bill to construct a framework for the official digital currency that the Reserve Bank of India will issue later. In a statement, the central bank said that it had \"serious concerns\" regarding private cryptocurrencies and announced plans to launch its own digital currency by December.  Large groups of local investors were attracted to Bitcoin, which is the world's largest cryptocurrency with a price hovering around $60,000 each. Since the start of the year, the crypto's price has doubled, Reuters\u00a0reported. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said earlier this month that all democratic nations must cooperate with each other to make sure that cryptocurrency did not fall into the wrong hands. The official's first public comment regarding the subject of crypto also argued that the industry could spoil the youth. Read Also: Oil Prices Jump Despite Biden Announcing Release of 50 Million Barrels From Strategic Reserve The bill's proposal to have a pre-verification approach would create obstacles for thousands of peer-to-peer currencies that thrive on being outside regulatory scrutiny. The Indian government earlier this year considered labeling the possession, issuance, mining, trading, and transfer of crypto-assets as criminal acts. Recently, Modi also chaired a meeting where officials discussed the future of cryptocurrencies in India. The talks occurred amid rising concerns that unregulated crypto markets could be used for money laundering and terror financing schemes, Euro News\u00a0reported. The announcement of the bill has dealt a huge blow to cryptocurrencies in India, causing prices to drop. Bitcoin fell more than 13% on WazirX while both Shiba Inu and Dogecoin fell more than 15% just a few hours after the announcement. However, the price drops were only limited to Indian trading platforms. The bill initially seems similar to the draft bill submitted in January but certainties cannot be made until it is made publicly available. In recent months, however, more are expecting the government to soften its views on crypto and instead regulate digital currencies as assets instead of a means of payment. The co-founder of Crypto India, Aditya Singh, said that the latest bill was still a mystery because it was never made public. The official said it was difficult to determine what can be gained because the bill could be an amended version of the initial draft bill the IMC committee revealed in January. Singh said that while the two bills shared the same title and description, there was a large possibility that the content had changed significantly. She noted that India's Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, made a recent statement saying the government will not move forward with a blanket ban on crypto, CoinDesk\u00a0reported.

Justin Bieber, Doja Cat, Billie Eilish and Lil Nas X were all nominated in the record, song and album of the year categories. Bieber and Doja Cat, along with H.E.R., each collected eight overall nominations, while Eilish and Rodrigo each earned seven. Rodrigo will compete for the best new artist prize with Arooj Aftab, Jimmie Allen, Baby Keem, FINNEAS, Glass Animals, Japanese Breakfast, The Kid Laroi, Arlo Parks and Saweetie. Rodrigo's song ``Drivers License'' earned nods for both record and song of the year, while she also landed in the album of the year category for ``Sour.'' The record of the year prize recognizes the artist, while the song of the year award goes to the songwriters. Billie Eilish swept all four of the top Grammy categories -- best new artist and record, song and album of the year -- in 2020, becoming the first artist to do so since Christopher Cross in 1981. In addition to Rodrigo's ``Sour,'' nominations for album of the year went to Batiste for ``We Are,'' Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga for ``Love for Sale,'' Bieber for ``Justice (Triple Chucks Deluxe),'' Doja Cat for ``Planet Her (Deluxe),'' Eilish for ``Happier Than Ever,'' H.E.R. for ``Back of My Mind,'' Lil Nas X for ``Montero,'' Taylor Swift for ``Evermore'' and Kanye West -- now known simply as Ye -- for ``Donda.'' Nominated for record of the year were ``I Still Have Faith In You'' by ABBA, ``Freedom'' by Batiste, ``I Get A Kick Out Of You'' by Bennett and Lady Gaga, ``Peaches'' by Bieber featuring Daniel Caesar & Giveon, ``Right On Time'' by Brandi Carlile, ``Kiss Me More'' by Doja Cat featuring SZA, ``Happier Than Ever'' by Eilish, ``Montero (Call Me By Your Name)'' by Lil Nas X, ``Drivers License'' by Rodrigo and ``Leave The Door Open'' by Silk Sonic. Song of the year nods went to the writers behind Ed Sheeran's ``Bad Habits,'' Alicia Keys and Brandi Carlile's ``A Beautiful Noise,'' Rodrigo's ``Drivers License,'' H.E.R.'s ``Fight for You,'' Eilish's ``Happier Than Ever,'' Doja Cat featuring SZA's ``Kiss Me More,'' Silk Sonic's ``Leave the Door Open,'' Lil Nas X's ``Montero (Call Me by Your Name),'' Bieber's ``Peaches'' and Carlile's ``Right on Time.'' The Grammys will be presented Jan. 31 at Crypto.com Arena, as Staples Center will be known as of Dec. 25. The Grammy nominations process underwent an overhaul in the past year, following loud criticism that erupted last year over the use of nominating committees that determined nominees in most categories. The criticism came after The Weeknd, who had some of the most critically acclaimed work of the year, was snubbed in all categories. According to the Recording Academy, the Nominations Review Committees -- made up of unnamed ``highly skilled music peers'' -- were eliminated this year for all genre and general categories, including the top honors of record, album and song of the year and best new artist. Instead, nominees will be determined by voting members of the academy. ``While change and progress are key drivers of our actions, one thing will always remain -- the Grammy Award is the only peer-driven and peer-voted recognition in music,'' Harvey Mason Jr., interim president/CEO of the Recording Academy, said when the change was announced. ``We are honored to work alongside the music community year-round to further refine and protect the integrity of the awards process.'' In other rule changes, the number of genre field categories in which members can vote was reduced from 15 to 10, and the 10 categories can be spread across no more than three fields (genres). All voters, however, can vote in the top four general categories -- album, song and record of the year and best new artist. The academy also consolidated six ``craft'' fields into two -- presentation and production. Two new categories were also added -- best global music performance and best musica urbana album. The Grammy nominations were announced in a virtual fashion, led by Mason at the Grammy Museum in downtown Los Angeles. He was joined by an array of personalities, including H.E.R., Batiste, Gayle King, BTS, Carly Pearce and others.

Read more about how we make money > Shares of Fluence Energy Inc (NASDAQ: FLNC) are up more than 4.0% on Tuesday after Evercore ISI said last night the stock had significant upside potential. Evercore\u2019s James West assumed coverage of Fluence Energy on Monday with a price target of $47 that represents a 30% upside from here. In his note, the analyst called the stock a \u201cmust-own\u201d in the energy storage sector. \n  Are you looking for fast-news, hot-tips and market analysis?\n  \n    Sign-up for the Invezz newsletter, today.\n  \n West agrees that there are about a dozen battery names that are worth owning at this point in time. But Fluence has the \u201cscarcity value\u201d as it\u2019s in the energy storage business \u2013 one that isn\u2019t nearly as crowded. The news comes less than a month after the renewable energy company debuted on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange at a per-share price of $35. The IPO brought in nearly a billion-dollar in new capital. Reiterating his bullish call on CNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Exchange\u201d, West predicted a bright future for the Virginia-based company. They\u2019re backed by AES and Siemens. They have strong backers, they have strong demand, and most customers say that they have the best product in the market. So, we think Fluence has a ton of upside from here. This is our favourite in the battery storage space right now. According to the Evercore ISI analyst, the sooner Fluence hits profitability, the faster it will turn from a \u201crevenue growth story\u201d to a \u201cprofitable growth story\u201d, which ultimately will favour higher valuation. A day earlier, Fluence said it had signed a contract with Enel X to provide Fast Reserve Grid Services for Terna. The U.S. firm currently boasts a market cap of $6.13 billion.

Read more about how we make money > Shares of HP Inc (NYSE: HPQ) were up 8.0% in extended trading on a sharp increase in quarterly revenue led by personal computer sales. The American multinational gave strong guidance for the future but warned that supply constraints will continue in H1 of 2022. On Mad Money with Jim Cramer, CEO Enrique Lores reiterated that the strength of the PC business was a secular event, not a cyclical one. \n  Are you looking for fast-news, hot-tips and market analysis?\n  \n    Sign-up for the Invezz newsletter, today.\n  \n We expect the PC business to continue to be very strong for the foreseeable future. What is driving demand now is the commercial side as offices are reopening, companies are investing to improve the experience of their employees, and this continues to drive very strong PC demand. He agreed that revenue from the consumer segment was down in Q4 but said it was primarily because HP was prioritising commercial in a supply constraint environment as it\u2019s better for the margin.
