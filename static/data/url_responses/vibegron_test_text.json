In the primary efficacy analysis, the study did not meet the primary endpoint with 40.9 percent of vibegron IBS-D patients achieving at least a 30 percent improvement in average worst abdominal pain over the week 12 period, compared to 42.9 percent in the placebo group. A responder was defined as a subject with at least a 30 percent decrease in \u201cworst abdominal pain in the past 24 hours\u201d compared to the weekly baseline average over the 12-week period.\n \nThe most important secondary endpoint demonstrated 42.4 percent of Global Improvement Scale (GIS) responders at Week 12 for IBS-D patients in the vibegron group, compared with 33.3 percent for placebo but this was not statistically significant for the IBS-D, IBS-M or the overall IBS population. Urovant will continue to analyze the full data set of this study.\n \nVibegron was very well tolerated in the study and did not lead to any worsening of IBS symptoms. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 0 percent in the vibegron group and 2.7 percent in placebo. The frequency of serious adverse events was similar across treatment arms with 1 serious adverse effect in the placebo group and 2 in the vibegron treatment group which were not considered treatment related by the investigator. The adverse events reported for vibegron were in the placebo range (33.3 percent in both groups). In particular, the adverse events of worsening of IBS were 2.7 percent for both vibegron and placebo and the adverse event of diarrhea was 0 percent for vibegron 75 mg and 1.8 percent for placebo respectively.\n \n\u201cWhile we are disappointed by the topline results from this Phase 2a trial, we want to sincerely thank the patients, investigators and their site staff who participated,\u201d said Cornelia Haag-Molkenteller, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer of Urovant Sciences. \u201cWe look forward to advancing our Phase 3 program for vibegron in men with overactive bladder and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), as well as our Phase 2a program for URO-902 in OAB and look forward to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) upcoming assigned Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of December 26, 2020 for the New Drug Application (NDA) for vibegron to treat overactive bladder (OAB).\u201d\n \nAbout Irritable Bowel Syndrome Related Pain\n \nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by recurrent abdominal pain associated with two or more of the following symptoms: defecation, change in stool frequency, and/or change in stool form or appearance. In the United States, approximately 30 million to 40 million have IBS symptoms, 30 percent of whom consult with a physician.1 Approximately 80 percent of these patients identify pain as a symptom contributing to the severity of their IBS2 and it is estimated 7.2 million to 9.6 million IBS patients suffer from IBS-associated pain.1 While there are approved therapies for IBS with constipation and IBS with diarrhea, these therapies do not adequately address IBS-associated pain. Moreover, there are no currently marketed drugs indicated specifically for IBS-associated pain.3\n \nAbout Vibegron \n \nVibegron is an oral, once-daily small molecule beta-3 agonist that is being evaluated for overactive bladder (OAB), OAB in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (OAB+BPH) and for abdominal pain associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\n \nUrovant has submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) for vibegron in OAB to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA), which has an assigned Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of December 26th. Data available to date on vibegron, which includes an international Phase 3 safety and efficacy study for OAB, indicate vibegron is well tolerated. If approved, vibegron would be the first new branded prescription drug for the treatment of OAB in nearly a decade and would offer these suffering patients another potential treatment option.\n \nAbout Urovant Sciences\n \nUrovant Sciences is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies for urologic conditions. The Company\u2019s lead product candidate, vibegron is being evaluated for overactive bladder (OAB), OAB in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (OAB+BPH), and for abdominal pain associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Urovant\u2019s second product candidate, URO-902, is a novel gene therapy being developed for patients with OAB who have failed oral pharmacologic therapy. \n \nUrovant Sciences, a subsidiary of Sumitovant Biopharma Ltd., which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd., intends to develop novel treatments for additional urologic diseases.

        "article_text": " Agreement will supplement Urovant's targeted sales and market access efforts in the launch of vibegron by expanding the outreach to Primary Care Physicians and their patients  Urovant Sciences (Nasdaq: UROV) today announced it has entered into a five-year U.S. co-promotion agreement with Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc. to promote vibegron in the primary care segment upon receiving U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the drug. In March 2020, the FDA accepted the New Drug Application (NDA) for vibegron in overactive bladder (OAB) and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of December 26, 2020.\r\n Under the terms of the agreement, Sunovion will deploy its multi-specialty sales force to bring vibegron to primary care physicians (PCP). In support of this effort, Sunovion will provide sales and marketing activities targeting the PCP segment through March 31, 2026. In compensation for its sales and marketing activities during the period of this agreement, Sunovion will receive a mid-single digit repayment fee based on the net sales of vibegron beginning on April 1, 2023.\r\n \"The co-promotion agreement with Sunovion significantly expands our planned commercial footprint for vibegron as we look forward to the potential approval and launch of vibegron in the coming months. While Urovant sales representatives will be focused on urologists, long-term care, and high-prescribing PCPs, the Sunovion team will significantly broaden our reach into the U.S. primary care community,\" said Walt Johnston, Urovant's Senior Vice President of Commercial. \"This is a great example of the strategic benefit of our affiliation with the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Group of companies. This partnership allows us to reach the PCP community without incurring any cash outlay through March 2023.\"\r\n \"We are pleased to deepen our commercial relationship with Urovant,\" said Thomas Gibbs, SVP and Chief Commercial Officer of Sunovion. \"Together, we expect to accelerate Urovant's path forward by leveraging Sunovion's sales expertise and infrastructure for co-promotion activities within the primary care specialty.\"\r\n The co-promotion agreement is in addition to the exclusive three-year agreement Urovant entered into with Sunovion in June 2020 for services related to wholesale trade and retail distribution, contract operations, and select account management activities for vibegron.

        "article_text": " Key secondary endpoint of Global Improvement Scale (GIS) showed numerical differences in favor of vibegron versus placebo, however data was not statistically significant  Vibegron was generally well-tolerated with safety profile comparable to placebo Urovant Sciences (Nasdaq: UROV)today reported topline data from the Phase 2a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating once-daily vibegron 75 mg in women with abdominal pain due to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with IBS-D (diarrhea) and IBS-M (mixed IBS).\r\n A total of 222 female IBS patients were enrolled at 35 sites in the United States, 189 of whom completed the 12-week study. In the primary efficacy analysis, the study did not meet the primary endpoint with 40.9 percent of vibegron IBS-D patients achieving at least a 30 percent improvement in average worst abdominal pain over the week 12 period, compared to 42.9 percent in the placebo group. A responder was defined as a subject with at least a 30 percent decrease in \"worst abdominal pain in the past 24 hours\" compared to the weekly baseline average over the 12-week period.\r\n The most important secondary endpoint demonstrated 42.4 percent of Global Improvement Scale (GIS) responders at Week 12 for IBS-D patients in the vibegron group, compared with 33.3 percent for placebo but this was not statistically significant for the IBS-D, IBS-M or the overall IBS population. Urovant will continue to analyze the full data set of this study.\r\n Vibegron was very well tolerated in the study and did not lead to any worsening of IBS symptoms. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 0 percent in the vibegron group and 2.7 percent in placebo. The frequency of serious adverse events was similar across treatment arms with 1 serious adverse effect in the placebo group and 2 in the vibegron treatment group which were not considered treatment related by the investigator. The adverse events reported for vibegron were in the placebo range (33.3 percent in both groups). In particular, the adverse events of worsening of IBS were 2.7 percent for both vibegron and placebo and the adverse event of diarrhea was 0 percent for vibegron 75 mg and 1.8 percent for placebo respectively.\r\n \"While we are disappointed by the topline results from this Phase 2a trial, we want to sincerely thank the patients, investigators and their site staff who participated,\" said Cornelia Haag-Molkenteller, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer of Urovant Sciences. \"We look forward to advancing our Phase 3 program for vibegron in men with overactive bladder and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), as well as our Phase 2a program for URO-902 in OAB and look forward to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) upcoming assigned Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of December 26, 2020 for the New Drug Application (NDA) for vibegron to treat overactive bladder (OAB).\"\r\n  About Irritable Bowel Syndrome Related Pain Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by recurrent abdominal pain associated with two or more of the following symptoms: defecation, change in stool frequency, and/or change in stool form or appearance. In the United States, approximately 30 million to 40 million have IBS symptoms, 30 percent of whom consult with a physician.1 Approximately 80 percent of these patients identify pain as a symptom contributing to the severity of their IBS2 and it is estimated 7.2 million to 9.6 million IBS patients suffer from IBS-associated pain.1 While there are approved therapies for IBS with constipation and IBS with diarrhea, these therapies do not adequately address IBS-associated pain. Moreover, there are no currently marketed drugs indicated specifically for IBS-associated pain.3  About Vibegron  Vibegron is an oral, once-daily small molecule beta-3 agonist that is being evaluated for overactive bladder (OAB), OAB in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (OAB+BPH) and for abdominal pain associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\r\n Urovant has submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) for vibegron in OAB to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA), which has an assigned Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of December 26th. Data available to date on vibegron, which includes an international Phase 3 safety and efficacy study for OAB, indicate vibegron is well tolerated. If approved, vibegron would be the first new branded prescription drug for the treatment of OAB in nearly a decade and would offer these suffering patients another potential treatment option.\r\n  About Urovant Sciences  Urovant Sciences is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies for urologic conditions.

        "article_text": "\nExtension study demonstrates favorable results in long term treatment of overactive bladder with vibegron, including improvements in incontinence efficacy, quality of life endpoints and with good tolerability \n \nLong term EMPOWUR extension study data featured in an oral presentation at the virtual International Continence Society (ICS) Annual Meeting\n \nMeta-analysis on increased risk of incident dementia following use of anticholinergics will also be presented at ICS\n IRVINE, Calif. & BASEL, Switzerland--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Urovant Sciences (Nasdaq: UROV) today announced positive efficacy and safety data from the vibegron EMPOWUR long term extension study with patient data over a total exposure of 52 weeks. The data demonstrate that vibegron improved quality of life (QoL) and incontinence efficacy endpoints with good long term tolerability in adult patients with overactive bladder (OAB) and symptoms of urge urinary incontinence (UUI), urgency and urinary frequency.\n  \nVibegron is a once-daily, beta-3 adrenergic agonist under investigation for the treatment of OAB by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In March 2020, the FDA accepted the New Drug Application (NDA) for vibegron in OAB and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of December 26, 2020.\n \nIn an oral presentation at the virtual International Continence Society (ICS) Annual Meeting, David Staskin, MD, presented results from the 40-week EMPOWUR extension to the 12-week EMPOWUR trial that show 75 mg of vibegron was well tolerated over the total exposure of 52 weeks and demonstrated numerically greater improvements from baseline compared with tolterodine across QoL and responder efficacy endpoints. These results are consistent with the results from the placebo-controlled EMPOWUR phase 3 study, with comparable safety and durable efficacy.\n \n\u201cA large segment of the OAB population suffers in silence because they are embarrassed, afraid, or unaware that there are treatments, including medications, that could address their problems with bladder control. This situation leads to OAB being overlooked and undertreated, and highlights the need for therapeutic options to improve quality of life,\u201d said Dr. Staskin, principal investigator of the EMPOWUR study, leading urologist with St. Elizabeth\u2019s Medical Center, and Associate Professor of Urology at Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston. \u201cThe EMPOWUR 40-week extension study demonstrated how vibegron, if approved by the FDA, has the potential to offer a lasting solution for adult patients with OAB to manage urinary frequency and urinary incontinence associated with the urgent need to go to the bathroom.\u201d\n \nAt week 52, 61 percent of 143 vibegron-treated patients had a \u226575 percent reduction and 40.8 percent showed a 100 percent reduction in UUI (urge urinary incontinence), a key symptom for OAB patients. In addition, 71.1 percent had \u226550 percent reduction in total incontinence episodes from baseline to week 52. In this same time period, vibegron demonstrated numerically greater improvements from baseline versus tolterodine for all QoL subscale scores as measured by the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire Long Form (OAB-qLF), including coping, concern, sleep, social interaction, health-related QoL and symptom bother. Vibegron 75 mg once daily demonstrated a 40-week safety profile comparable to that of 12-week EMPOWUR study, as well as durable efficacy for QoL and incontinence efficacy endpoints. Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 62.6% (171/273) of vibegron and 54.3% (126/232) of tolterodine patients; 4 (1.5%) vibegron and 8 (3.4%) tolterodine patients discontinued study medication due to an AE.\n \nExamining the Risk of Cognitive Effects Associated with Anticholinergic Agents \n \nOn November 20, there will be a presentation of findings from a recent meta-analysis of anticholinergic use by Dr. Roger Dmochowski, which was supported by Urovant. The systemic literature review and meta-analysis revealed that use of anticholinergic agents for three months or longer increased the risk of incident dementia by an average of 46 percent relative to non-use. This increased risk also was reported in the six studies included in the meta-analysis that evaluated anticholinergic medications used to treat overactive bladder.\n \nAnticholinergic medications are currently the most frequently prescribed pharmaceutical treatment for OAB. They exert their effects by blocking the action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and are prescribed to treat a wide range of medical conditions.\n \n\u201cThe findings from our systematic literature review and meta-analysis shine a light on what data and anecdotal evidence has demonstrated for many practicing physicians: ongoing use of anticholinergics to treat OAB comes with an increased risk,\u201d said Dr. Dmochowski, associate surgeon in chief and Professor of Urologic Surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \u201cThese findings underscore the need for medicines that can treat conditions such as OAB without the potential cognitive risks associated with anticholinergic agents. It is essential that health care providers work with their patients to determine an appropriate treatment plan.\u201d\n \nAbout Urovant Sciences\n \nUrovant Sciences is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies for urologic conditions. The Company\u2019s lead product candidate, vibegron, is an oral, once-daily small molecule beta-3 agonist that is being evaluated for overactive bladder (OAB). Urovant Sciences reported positive data from the vibegron 12-week, phase 3 pivotal EMPOWUR study and demonstrated favorable longer-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability in a 40-week extension study. The Company submitted a New Drug Application to the FDA seeking approval of vibegron for the treatment of patients with OAB in December 2019. Vibegron is also being evaluated for treatment of OAB in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (OAB+BPH) and for abdominal pain associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

[Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the conference to your speaker today, Ryan Kubota, investor relations. Please go ahead, sir. Ryan Kubota -- Investor Relations Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining Urovant's fiscal 2020 second-quarter financial results conference call. With me today are key members of our leadership team: Jim Robinson, president and chief executive officer; Ajay Bansal, chief financial officer; and Dr. Cornelia Haag-Molkenteller, chief medical officer. Christine Ocampo, our chief accounting officer, is also present and will join us on the Q&A portion of the call. Today, after market close, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our quarterly results. You may access the release on our company website, urovant.com. We use our website as a channel to distribute important and time-critical company information, and you should look to the Investor Relations page of our website for this information.  During our call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our plans and strategies for the clinical development of vibegron and other treatments for urologic diseases. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to numerous risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Accordingly, we advise listeners to review the forward-looking statement disclosures in today's press release, the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, as well as our Form 10-Q, which will be filed soon. With that said, I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Robinson. Jim?  Jim Robinson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Ryan, and thanks to all of you for joining the call today. In our second fiscal quarter of 2020, Urovant continued to make strong progress preparing for the anticipated approval and commercial launch of vibegron, as well as advancing our clinical programs. I'll start today's call discussing the status of our regulatory and commercial activities for vibegron in overactive bladder. In regards to our new drug application, we continue to be engaged with the FDA and our interactions with the agency remain on track as we continue to work toward our upcoming PDUFA date of December 26. With just over a month until reaching this pivotal period in the company's history, we're actively preparing for the expected commercial launch of vibegron late in the first quarter of 2021. Now, let me provide you with an update on the hiring of our sales force, our co-promotion agreement with Sunovion, our market access activities, and our marketing plans. In terms of our sales force, our sales leadership team has been hired and is on board. I'm pleased to say that this team of 20 individuals brings a significant amount of knowledge and proficiency to Urovant, with combined experience of nearly 260 years in the pharmaceutical industry and an average of 10 years of experience in the urology space. We're now in the process of recruiting approximately 120 representatives for our urology sales force and approximately 35 representatives for our long-term care sales force. I'm very pleased with the significant level of interest that we received from these highly qualified applicants. With this sales effort at launch, we'll have the highest share of voice in the combined urology specialty and long-term care segments of the overactive bladder market. Our urology specialty sales force will also call on the top prescribing primary care providers. And to augment our efforts in the primary care space, we recently signed a co-promotion agreement with Sunovion. Sunovion's multi-specialty sales force will enable us to further expand into medium- and high-prescribing Primary Care Physicians. This is an important factor when you consider that our primary care providers represent approximately 40% of all prescriptions in overactive bladder. Under this agreement, Sunovion will invest more than $60 million in sales and marketing activities from the launch of vibegron through March 31, 2023. We expect this agreement to create significant value by amplifying our reach within this critical segment of the market without the need for us to deploy additional capital. Now, let me provide you an update on our efforts and market access. Since August, our market access teams have been meeting with key payers to introduce and educate them on vibegron through preapproval information exchange meetings. These meetings have given us the opportunity to discuss with payers the safety and efficacy data that vibegron has demonstrated in our pivotal EMPOWUR trial, as well as the clinical value proposition that we believe vibegron will provide if approved. These meetings have been beneficial as we prepare for launch. Now, shifting to our marketing efforts, our sales teams will be supported by an extensive multichannel marketing campaign. We've launched non-branded healthcare provider and consumer communications through various digital partnerships. This platform will engage healthcare providers, patients, and payers alike, all of whom play an important role in our launch efforts. Additionally, our sales leaders have engaged key stakeholders to further educate them on our company and pipeline, and the response has been very positive. As we shared with you on our last call, we've launched non-branded virtual community, bladderchatter.com, over the summer. The purpose of this community is to help change the dialogue around overactive bladder, which is often misunderstood, stigmatized, and too often accepted as normal. bladderchatter.com provides a forum where people can learn from each other and discuss their overactive bladder issues and concerns. With more than 170,000 site visits and approximately 12,000 individual registrations, we've learned a lot. Through this virtual community, it's very clear that people suffering from overactive bladder are seeking a better alternative to what's available today. Some key insights include that 86% are bothered or very bothered by overactive bladder; 73% have discussed their symptoms with their doctor and 68% are not currently on treatment. By bringing to market a potentially best-in-class treatment, we hope to make a significant contribution to alleviating the symptoms of overactive bladder from many of these patients. In summary, we believe that we're well prepared to successfully commercialize vibegron, pending the FDA's approval. Now, let me briefly transition over to our development pipeline, which Cornelia will then get into more detail on in a moment. We're pleased with the ongoing progress we've made in a number of programs designed to maximize the value of vibegron beyond its initial indication for overactive bladder. Our lead clinical program, the Phase 3 COURAGE study, is developing vibegron to treat men with overactive bladder and BPH. We're continuing to enroll patients into this study and expect top-line results in the second half of 2021. Our second clinical program for vibegron is the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome pain. We currently expect to have top-line results for our Phase 2a study for this program in the coming weeks. Regarding our second development program, URO-902, a novel injectable gene therapy for the treatment of overactive bladder, we are continuing to enroll patients who have failed oral pharmacological therapy for OAB into our Phase 2a trial. The decision to move from cohort 1 to cohort 2 will be made on the recommendation from the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, and is expected to occur in early 2021. This concludes my opening remarks. And let me now turn the call over to our chief medical officer, Dr. Cornelia Haag-Molkenteller. Cornelia Haag-Molkenteller -- Chief Medical Officer Thank you, Jim. As previously announced and Jim just discussed, we submitted our new drug application for vibegron with the treatment of OAB to the FDA in December of 2019. On March 5, the FDA notified us that they accepted the NDA for review that our PDUFA date is December 26, 2020. We continue to respond to FDA request as part of the regular review cycle, and we remain confident in the data and NDA we submitted for vibegron. Let me take a minute to provide some details on the upcoming data presentations that we have planned for vibegron and OAB, as well as for our ongoing clinical development programs. The International Continent Society, ICS meeting, is taking place from November 19 to 22, 2020, and is scheduled as a virtual meeting. The quality of life responder data from the Phase 3 EMPOWUR extension study have been accepted for a presentation and will be available on November 19. As you may remember, this was the double-blind extension study of the placebo-controlled EMPOWUR pivotal study. Patients in this study received either 75-milligram vibegron or 4-milligram extended-release tolterodine. Vibegron was able to sustain its efficacy for over 52 weeks of observation, with very favorable long-term efficacy results including the key symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, urge urinary incontinence, total incontinence, and it also demonstrated a good long-term safety and tolerability profile. The patients respond on the quality of life scores as on the disease-specific questionnaire OAB-q in this study corresponded well with the improvements in OAB symptoms, again, demonstrating the sustained efficacy of 75-milligram vibegron over time. Urinary urge incontinence is one of the leading symptoms of OAB that cause patients to seek treatment. Our data show that 71% of patients treated with vibegron experienced a 50% reduction of the baseline incontinence episodes at week 52 in contrast to only 61.9% in the tolterodine group. And 40.8% of all patients in the vibegron treatment group became dry, meaning that they did not have any incontinence episodes in contrast to only 34.2% in the tolterodine group at week 52. I will now comment on our ongoing clinical trials. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, we had temporarily halted the enrollment of new patients into ongoing clinical trials in mid-March 2020. At the end of April, we began to reopen our trial sites for the screening of new patients in all of our trials in a stepwise manner. For a Phase 3 COURAGE development program for vibegron in men with OAB and benign prostatic hypoplasia or BPH, we're now in Part 2 of this large trial, in which over 1,000 patients will be enrolled. The trial is taking place in North America and Europe, with study sites initiated in Europe. Part 2 of this Phase 3 trial will assess both the efficacy and safety of vibegron in men with OAB and BPH. The co-primary endpoints are reduction in duration frequency and urgency episodes for 24 hours. Key secondary endpoints are reduction in nocturia episodes, which is the awakening at night to void, prostate symptom scores, and safety. Additionally, the first patients are also enrolling into a long-term extension trial, which will follow patients for a total exposure of 52 weeks. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation and the increase in the number of cases reported in the U.S. and many European countries, we're continuing to monitor the situation closely with respect to enrollment. As a reminder, there is currently no FDA-approved product specifically indicated for overactive bladder in men with BPH. Regarding our Phase 2a clinical program for vibegron and IBS-associated abdominal pain, we completed the enrollment of 222 female patients with IBS-associated abdominal pain at the end of June 2020. Patients were randomized to either 75-milligram of vibegron or placebo. The primary endpoint is a 30% reduction in abdominal pain intensity on an 11-point rating scale, ranging from zero to 10 over 12 weeks for IBS-D, which is the IBS with diarrhea. A response is defined as a subject with at least a 30% decrease in worst abdominal pain compared to the weekly baseline average. Secondary endpoints include the global rating scale and safety, in particular, lack of negative effects on stool frequency or consistency. We now plan to report top-line data from this study at the end of this month. Regarding the development program for URO-902, our novel injectable gene therapy for the treatment of OAB, we're studying URO-902 in a Phase 2a trial and are enrolling patients with OAB with a failed oral pharmacologic therapy. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a single administration of URO-902 running in the U.S. This therapy is administered via direct intradetrusor injected into the bladder wall under local anesthesia. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 80 female patients in the U.S. in two cohorts. The first cohort will receive either a single administration of 24-milligram of URO-902 or matching placebo. And the second cohort will receive 48-milligram of URO-902 for matching placebo. The primary outcome measure is the change in the average daily number of urge urinary incontinence episodes from baseline at week 12, as well as assessment of the safety and tolerability of this new potential therapy. Patients will then be followed for up to 48 weeks after one injection. The decision to move from cohort 1 to cohort 2 will be made on the recommendation from the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board or DSMB. This trial is only running in the U.S. And based on the enrollment levels due to COVID-19 situation, the DSMB meeting will now be held in early 2021. I'm pleased with the progress we made despite the enrollment challenges presented by COVID-19, and I look forward to providing you with further updates in the future. I'll now pass on to Ajay for a financial update. Ajay Bansal -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Cornelia, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on today's call during this exciting time in the company's history. Please note that in addition to the results summarized in our press release, you can find additional information in our upcoming Form 10-Q. R&D expenses were $14.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 compared with $17.8 million for the same period in the prior year. The year-over-year decrease is primarily due to a $6.8 million reduction in our CRO costs stemming from the completion of the double-blind extension study of our EMPOWUR study in the prior year and the completion of enrollment in our Phase 2a trial for the treatment of abdominal pain due to IBS in June this year. This decrease was partially offset by an overall increase of $2 million for CMC costs, resulting from the manufacturing of initial validation batches and purchase of drug substance and other starting materials for future manufacturing campaigns of vibegron, as well as the manufacturing of drug substance for future clinical supplies of URO-902. G&A expenses were $18.9 million for the second fiscal quarter of 2020 compared with $7.4 million for the same period in the prior year. G&A expenses have gone up due to an increase of $5.4 million in commercial readiness costs and an increase of $4.9 million in personnel-related costs as we continue to prepare for the commercial launch of vibegron if approved. Total operating expenses were $33.5 million for the second quarter of 2020 compared with $25.2 million for the same period in the prior year. Net loss was $35.2 million or $1.12 per share for the second quarter of 2020 compared with a net loss of $25.7 million or $0.85 per share for the same period in the prior year. Cash used in operations was $32.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2020, as compared to $30.8 million in the immediate prior quarter ended June 30, 2020. As of September 30, 2020, total cash on hand was $74.4 million. At the end of the quarter, we still had $128.5 million available for drawdown under our low interest, five-year term loan facility with DSP. Looking ahead, for the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect our cash burn to be approximately $45 million. For the full fiscal-year 2020, we now project a cash burn between $185 million and $190 million. With that financial update, I would like to turn the call back over to Jim. Jim Robinson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Ajay. As we prepare to go to your questions, I'd like to summarize how we're thinking about what we've accomplished to date and our focus for the future. We're pleased with the progress we've made thus far, and we continue to make strides across all aspects of our business. We have several upcoming important milestones during the remainder of our fiscal year, including top-line efficacy and safety data from the Phase 2a study of vibegron for the treatment of IBS-associated pain later this month; the potential approval of vibegron late next month, the expected completion of cohort 1 enrollment in the Phase 2a of our novel injectable gene therapy for overactive bladder, URO-902; and the commercial launch of vibegron, if approved, in the first quarter of calendar year 2021. In anticipation of vibegron's approval, we're focused on building our commercial team and executing on our launch plan. In summary, we believe we're well-positioned to be a strong leading competitor in this market and are excited about the future. And with that, we finished our prepared remarks, and we'll now go to questions. Operator? Operator Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Ram Selvaraju with H.C. Wainwright. Your line is now open. Ram Selvaraju -- H.C. Wainwright -- Analyst Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, would it be possible for you to comment on the nature of the sales force that the DSP is likely to be using in support of vibegron as part of the co-promotion arrangement. And in particular, how large this group is expected to be, and what other products they are currently promoting? And how much of their time they're expected to be devoting to detailing vibegron? Jim Robinson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Hey, Ram. It's Jim. Thanks for your question. So let me maybe give you a sense of the criteria in terms of what was important to us when we were evaluating partners in this area. First, we wanted to make sure we had end-market successful experienced primary care team that was very important to us, having the relationships with the primary care providers, being in market, and having a demonstrated track record of success, as you would expect, was very important for us. Sunovion will be dedicating 90 sales professionals to vibegron. The other key component for us is we wanted someone that was willing to invest along with us. Part of the investment is effort. So Sunovion, the representatives that will be working on behalf of vibegron, it will be their primary detail, and it has to be at least 60% of their overall incentive compensation weighting. So it's a big part of their effort and it's going to be the first-line detail for that sales team. And we also wanted someone that was going to invest along with us. And as you saw, there's a willingness of Sunovion to invest $60 million over the first two years in not only people but also programs, marketing expenses in sample, etc. So in terms of the criteria that we laid out for the right partner, they met all the criteria for us. And so they're going to be very important for us in augmenting our primary care approach from that mid-decile to the high-decile prescribers. Ram Selvaraju -- H.C. Wainwright -- Analyst OK, great. And then with respect to the applicability of vibegron and IBS-associated pain, just wanted to get some clarity on what you folks expect to be the most critical secondary endpoints in the study from the vantage point of competitive positioning of the drug in this indication. And also, if you could elaborate on the pathway to formal approval in this indication, assuming that this study is positive, as well as how hypothetically vibegron would be positioned from a commercial standpoint vis-a-vis, for example, the way you allocate the sales effort, the commercial infrastructure with regard to this indication relative to the OAB indication. Thanks. Jim Robinson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Sure. So I'll let Cornelia add some color to this. But as you know, we've announced at the end of November, we expect to have the Phase 2a top-line results. At that point, we'll evaluate the Phase 2b/3 -- or Phase 2b/3 in combined development program requirements for our next step. In terms of utilizing the organization, there's two answers to that. Without question, we would utilize the existing sales and commercial infrastructure that we have. We find it to be extremely efficient. We would add potentially a little effort in the GI space as well, which would augment our already sizable sales organization. In terms of the other component is it allows for a differentiated label. So not only do we have a chance to differentiate the label in the U.S. but also abroad and would provide an opportunity to show that beyond the OAB indication, vibegron is effective. And let's say IBS pain, if successful, it also goes to speak to the development program we're doing in OAB and then with BPH. So either one of those indications provide for a significantly differentiated label in the U.S. and abroad. In terms of endpoints, in terms of primary and secondary, I'll let Cornelia handle that and maybe provide a little more color on the development programs, pending the outcome of the Phase 2a study that we'll get the readout on at the end of November. Cornelia? Cornelia Haag-Molkenteller -- Chief Medical Officer Yes. This is Cornelia. So again, it is like in all IBS studies. It is the reduction in the worst abdominal pain over the 12-week period. It's a 12-week study, double-blind, placebo-controlled. And again, as Jim said, this is a 75-milligram dose. So currently in the Phase 2a, we have studied one dose. If this continues, this program, we will probably have to study at least two doses. We will also be looking at no negative effects on stool consistency for IBS. Ram Selvaraju -- H.C. Wainwright -- Analyst OK. Perfect. And then just one very quick regarding DTC advertising. Cornelia Haag-Molkenteller -- Chief Medical Officer Sorry? Ram Selvaraju -- H.C. Wainwright -- Analyst Can you confirm that at that time that you expect vibegron to be launched, there's probably likely to be no significant or a tailing-off significance of counter detailing DTC presence of other OAB products as the vibegron class? Jim Robinson -- President and Chief Executive Officer I don't know if I could make a definitive statement on what another company will do with their DTC program. But what I can tell you is that we will have a multi-channel marketing campaign, as we've talked about previously, we expect to leverage digital and social channels. The evolution of the ability to reach people that are interested about learning more about overactive bladder has been significant. The ability to provide curated content on demand to people that are interested in learning more about how to talk to their doctor about it, as well as the potential products that are available significantly changed in the last five to 10 years. So we expect to be able to have a very successful and a very targeted direct-to-patient campaign launched sometime in 2021. So in terms of what other companies will do, I mean, I think we can only speculate. Ram Selvaraju -- H.C. Wainwright -- Analyst Thank you. Jim Robinson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Biren Amin with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Biren Amin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just on the vibegron potential approval. If you're approved later this month and with launch shortly thereafter, how should we think about the trajectory of the launch? Should we be looking at the vibegron TRx script count in the first few months of its launch and tracking to that? Jim Robinson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Hey, Biren, it's Jim. That's a good question. In terms of timing, again, the PDUFA date is December 26. We'll onboard our sales team over the course of January and February. We're interviewing them now, making contingent offers now. The offer would be effective upon the approval of vibegron. And so again, we do the onboarding and launching in the January, February time frame of that sales force with an expected launch in March, like we said, late 2021 -- or so late in the first quarter, excuse me, of 2021. In terms of the trajectory, as you probably know, the payer aspect is going to be important for us to be able to get access at launch. If I were to say, could you overlay the two launch curves? I think you're going to see that and vibegron's launch is going to be right from a standpoint of a trajectory similar, I would say, to mirabegron, probably slightly below until we have formulary access. But we do expect formulary access in the important plans, both in Part D and commercial in 2021 and early '22. And obviously, when we have formulary access at a critical mass, we expect that our launch trajectory will reflect that access and grow accordingly. Biren Amin -- Jefferies -- Analyst And so you talked about Part D. I guess is that component going to come through in 2022, Jim? Because that seems to take a little bit more time than the commercial payers. Jim Robinson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Generally, we said, 2021 bid cycles would have been in and reviewed at this point. So for us, without question, 2022 is an area of intense focus for Medicare Part D access. But beyond that, we still expect to get some access in Part D, and we expect some access in commercial. And as we've talked about previously, long-term care, we believe represents a significant opportunity for us to be able to provide access early in 2021 and be able to grow vibegron in that important segment of the market. Biren Amin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jim Robinson for closing remarks. Jim Robinson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you very much, operator. And again, I want to thank all of those that have attended today's call and also want to thank those for the questions. And we look forward to providing you an update on our next call. Thanks very much.

[Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the conference to your speaker today, Ryan Kubota, investor relations. Please go ahead, sir.Ryan Kubota -- Investor Relations Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining Urovant's fiscal 2020 second-quarter financial results conference call. With me today are key members of our leadership team: Jim Robinson, president and chief executive officer; Ajay Bansal, chief financial officer; and Dr. Cornelia Haag-Molkenteller, chief medical officer.\n\n \n\n\n\n Christine Ocampo, our chief accounting officer, is also present and will join us on the Q&A portion of the call. Today, after market close, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our quarterly results. You may access the release on our company website, urovant.com. We use our website as a channel to distribute important and time-critical company information, and you should look to the Investor Relations page of our website for this information.During our call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our plans and strategies for the clinical development of vibegron and other treatments for urologic diseases. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to numerous risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Accordingly, we advise listeners to review the forward-looking statement disclosures in today's press release, the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, as well as our Form 10-Q, which will be filed soon. With that said, I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Robinson. Jim? Jim Robinson -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\n \n\n\n\n Thank you, Ryan, and thanks to all of you for joining the call today. In our second fiscal quarter of 2020, Urovant continued to make strong progress preparing for the anticipated approval and commercial launch of vibegron, as well as advancing our clinical programs. I'll start today's call discussing the status of our regulatory and commercial activities for vibegron in overactive bladder. In regards to our new drug application, we continue to be engaged with the FDA and our interactions with the agency remain on track as we continue to work toward our upcoming PDUFA date of December 26. With just over a month until reaching this pivotal period in the company's history, we're actively preparing for the expected commercial launch of vibegron late in the first quarter of 2021. Now, let me provide you with an update on the hiring of our sales force, our co-promotion agreement with Sunovion, our market access activities, and our marketing plans. In terms of our sales force, our sales leadership team has been hired and is on board. I'm pleased to say that this team of 20 individuals brings a significant amount of knowledge and proficiency to Urovant, with combined experience of nearly 260 years in the pharmaceutical industry and an average of 10 years of experience in the urology space. We're now in the process of recruiting approximately 120 representatives for our urology sales force and approximately 35 representatives for our long-term care sales force. I'm very pleased with the significant level of interest that we received from these highly qualified applicants. With this sales effort at launch, we'll have the highest share of voice in the combined urology specialty and long-term care segments of the overactive bladder market. Our urology specialty sales force will also call on the top prescribing primary care providers. And to augment our efforts in the primary care space, we recently signed a co-promotion agreement with Sunovion. Sunovion's multi-specialty sales force will enable us to further expand into medium- and high-prescribing Primary Care Physicians. This is an important factor when you consider that our primary care providers represent approximately 40% of all prescriptions in overactive bladder. Under this agreement, Sunovion will invest more than $60 million in sales and marketing activities from the launch of vibegron through March 31, 2023.\n\n \n\n\n\n We expect this agreement to create significant value by amplifying our reach within this critical segment of the market without the need for us to deploy additional capital. Now, let me provide you an update on our efforts and market access. Since August, our market access teams have been meeting with key payers to introduce and educate them on vibegron through preapproval information exchange meetings. These meetings have given us the opportunity to discuss with payers the safety and efficacy data that vibegron has demonstrated in our pivotal EMPOWUR trial, as well as the clinical value proposition that we believe vibegron will provide if approved. These meetings have been beneficial as we prepare for launch. Now, shifting to our marketing efforts, our sales teams will be supported by an extensive multichannel marketing campaign. We've launched non-branded healthcare provider and consumer communications through various digital partnerships. This platform will engage healthcare providers, patients, and payers alike, all of whom play an important role in our launch efforts. Additionally, our sales leaders have engaged key stakeholders to further educate them on our company and pipeline, and the response has been very positive. As we shared with you on our last call, we've launched non-branded virtual community, bladderchatter.com, over the summer. The purpose of this community is to help change the dialogue around overactive bladder, which is often misunderstood, stigmatized, and too often accepted as normal. bladderchatter.com provides a forum where people can learn from each other and discuss their overactive bladder issues and concerns. With more than 170,000 site visits and approximately 12,000 individual registrations, we've learned a lot. Through this virtual community, it's very clear that people suffering from overactive bladder are seeking a better alternative to what's available today. Some key insights include that 86% are bothered or very bothered by overactive bladder; 73% have discussed their symptoms with their doctor and 68% are not currently on treatment. By bringing to market a potentially best-in-class treatment, we hope to make a significant contribution to alleviating the symptoms of overactive bladder from many of these patients. In summary, we believe that we're well prepared to successfully commercialize vibegron, pending the FDA's approval. Now, let me briefly transition over to our development pipeline, which Cornelia will then get into more detail on in a moment. We're pleased with the ongoing progress we've made in a number of programs designed to maximize the value of vibegron beyond its initial indication for overactive bladder. Our lead clinical program, the Phase 3 COURAGE study, is developing vibegron to treat men with overactive bladder and BPH. We're continuing to enroll patients into this study and expect top-line results in the second half of 2021. Our second clinical program for vibegron is the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome pain. We currently expect to have top-line results for our Phase 2a study for this program in the coming weeks. Regarding our second development program, URO-902, a novel injectable gene therapy for the treatment of overactive bladder, we are continuing to enroll patients who have failed oral pharmacological therapy for OAB into our Phase 2a trial. The decision to move from cohort 1 to cohort 2 will be made on the recommendation from the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, and is expected to occur in early 2021. This concludes my opening remarks. And let me now turn the call over to our chief medical officer, Dr. Cornelia Haag-Molkenteller.Cornelia Haag-Molkenteller -- Chief Medical Officer Thank you, Jim. As previously announced and Jim just discussed, we submitted our new drug application for vibegron with the treatment of OAB to the FDA in December of 2019. On March 5, the FDA notified us that they accepted the NDA for review that our PDUFA date is December 26, 2020. We continue to respond to FDA request as part of the regular review cycle, and we remain confident in the data and NDA we submitted for vibegron. Let me take a minute to provide some details on the upcoming data presentations that we have planned for vibegron and OAB, as well as for our ongoing clinical development programs. The International Continent Society, ICS meeting, is taking place from November 19 to 22, 2020, and is scheduled as a virtual meeting. The quality of life responder data from the Phase 3 EMPOWUR extension study have been accepted for a presentation and will be available on November 19. As you may remember, this was the double-blind extension study of the placebo-controlled EMPOWUR pivotal study. Patients in this study received either 75-milligram vibegron or 4-milligram extended-release tolterodine. Vibegron was able to sustain its efficacy for over 52 weeks of observation, with very favorable long-term efficacy results including the key symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, urge urinary incontinence, total incontinence, and it also demonstrated a good long-term safety and tolerability profile. The patients respond on the quality of life scores as on the disease-specific questionnaire OAB-q in this study corresponded well with the improvements in OAB symptoms, again, demonstrating the sustained efficacy of 75-milligram vibegron over time. Urinary urge incontinence is one of the leading symptoms of OAB that cause patients to seek treatment. Our data show that 71% of patients treated with vibegron experienced a 50% reduction of the baseline incontinence episodes at week 52 in contrast to only 61.9% in the tolterodine group. And 40.8% of all patients in the vibegron treatment group became dry, meaning that they did not have any incontinence episodes in contrast to only 34.2% in the tolterodine group at week 52. I will now comment on our ongoing clinical trials. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, we had temporarily halted the enrollment of new patients into ongoing clinical trials in mid-March 2020. At the end of April, we began to reopen our trial sites for the screening of new patients in all of our trials in a stepwise manner. For a Phase 3 COURAGE development program for vibegron in men with OAB and benign prostatic hypoplasia or BPH, we're now in Part 2 of this large trial, in which over 1,000 patients will be enrolled. The trial is taking place in North America and Europe, with study sites initiated in Europe. Part 2 of this Phase 3 trial will assess both the efficacy and safety of vibegron in men with OAB and BPH. The co-primary endpoints are reduction in duration frequency and urgency episodes for 24 hours. Key secondary endpoints are reduction in nocturia episodes, which is the awakening at night to void, prostate symptom scores, and safety. Additionally, the first patients are also enrolling into a long-term extension trial, which will follow patients for a total exposure of 52 weeks. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation and the increase in the number of cases reported in the U.S. and many European countries, we're continuing to monitor the situation closely with respect to enrollment. As a reminder, there is currently no FDA-approved product specifically indicated for overactive bladder in men with BPH. Regarding our Phase 2a clinical program for vibegron and IBS-associated abdominal pain, we completed the enrollment of 222 female patients with IBS-associated abdominal pain at the end of June 2020. Patients were randomized to either 75-milligram of vibegron or placebo. The primary endpoint is a 30% reduction in abdominal pain intensity on an 11-point rating scale, ranging from zero to 10 over 12 weeks for IBS-D, which is the IBS with diarrhea. A response is defined as a subject with at least a 30% decrease in worst abdominal pain compared to the weekly baseline average. Secondary endpoints include the global rating scale and safety, in particular, lack of negative effects on stool frequency or consistency. We now plan to report top-line data from this study at the end of this month. Regarding the development program for URO-902, our novel injectable gene therapy for the treatment of OAB, we're studying URO-902 in a Phase 2a trial and are enrolling patients with OAB with a failed oral pharmacologic therapy. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a single administration of URO-902 running in the U.S. This therapy is administered via direct intradetrusor injected into the bladder wall under local anesthesia. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 80 female patients in the U.S. in two cohorts. The first cohort will receive either a single administration of 24-milligram of URO-902 or matching placebo. And the second cohort will receive 48-milligram of URO-902 for matching placebo. The primary outcome measure is the change in the average daily number of urge urinary incontinence episodes from baseline at week 12, as well as assessment of the safety and tolerability of this new potential therapy. Patients will then be followed for up to 48 weeks after one injection. The decision to move from cohort 1 to cohort 2 will be made on the recommendation from the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board or DSMB. This trial is only running in the U.S. And based on the enrollment levels due to COVID-19 situation, the DSMB meeting will now be held in early 2021. I'm pleased with the progress we made despite the enrollment challenges presented by COVID-19, and I look forward to providing you with further updates in the future. I'll now pass on to Ajay for a financial update.Ajay Bansal -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Cornelia, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on today's call during this exciting time in the company's history. Please note that in addition to the results summarized in our press release, you can find additional information in our upcoming Form 10-Q. R&D expenses were $14.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 compared with $17.8 million for the same period in the prior year. The year-over-year decrease is primarily due to a $6.8 million reduction in our CRO costs stemming from the completion of the double-blind extension study of our EMPOWUR study in the prior year and the completion of enrollment in our Phase 2a trial for the treatment of abdominal pain due to IBS in June this year. This decrease was partially offset by an overall increase of $2 million for CMC costs, resulting from the manufacturing of initial validation batches and purchase of drug substance and other starting materials for future manufacturing campaigns of vibegron, as well as the manufacturing of drug substance for future clinical supplies of URO-902. G&A expenses were $18.9 million for the second fiscal quarter of 2020 compared with $7.4 million for the same period in the prior year. G&A expenses have gone up due to an increase of $5.4 million in commercial readiness costs and an increase of $4.9 million in personnel-related costs as we continue to prepare for the commercial launch of vibegron if approved. Total operating expenses were $33.5 million for the second quarter of 2020 compared with $25.2 million for the same period in the prior year. Net loss was $35.2 million or $1.12 per share for the second quarter of 2020 compared with a net loss of $25.7 million or $0.85 per share for the same period in the prior year. Cash used in operations was $32.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2020, as compared to $30.8 million in the immediate prior quarter ended June 30, 2020. As of September 30, 2020, total cash on hand was $74.4 million. At the end of the quarter, we still had $128.5 million available for drawdown under our low interest, five-year term loan facility with DSP. Looking ahead, for the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect our cash burn to be approximately $45 million. For the full fiscal-year 2020, we now project a cash burn between $185 million and $190 million. With that financial update, I would like to turn the call back over to Jim.Jim Robinson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Ajay. As we prepare to go to your questions, I'd like to summarize how we're thinking about what we've accomplished to date and our focus for the future. We're pleased with the progress we've made thus far, and we continue to make strides across all aspects of our business. We have several upcoming important milestones during the remainder of our fiscal year, including top-line efficacy and safety data from the Phase 2a study of vibegron for the treatment of IBS-associated pain later this month; the potential approval of vibegron late next month, the expected completion of cohort 1 enrollment in the Phase 2a of our novel injectable gene therapy for overactive bladder, URO-902; and the commercial launch of vibegron, if approved, in the first quarter of calendar year 2021. In anticipation of vibegron's approval, we're focused on building our commercial team and executing on our launch plan. In summary, we believe we're well-positioned to be a strong leading competitor in this market and are excited about the future. And with that, we finished our prepared remarks, and we'll now go to questions. Operator? Questions & Answers: OperatorThank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Ram Selvaraju with H.C. Wainwright. Your line is now open.Ram Selvaraju -- H.C. Wainwright -- Analyst Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, would it be possible for you to comment on the nature of the sales force that the DSP is likely to be using in support of vibegron as part of the co-promotion arrangement. And in particular, how large this group is expected to be, and what other products they are currently promoting? And how much of their time they're expected to be devoting to detailing vibegron?Jim Robinson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Hey, Ram. It's Jim. Thanks for your question. So let me maybe give you a sense of the criteria in terms of what was important to us when we were evaluating partners in this area. First, we wanted to make sure we had end-market successful experienced primary care team that was very important to us, having the relationships with the primary care providers, being in market, and having a demonstrated track record of success, as you would expect, was very important for us. Sunovion will be dedicating 90 sales professionals to vibegron. The other key component for us is we wanted someone that was willing to invest along with us. Part of the investment is effort. So Sunovion, the representatives that will be working on behalf of vibegron, it will be their primary detail, and it has to be at least 60% of their overall incentive compensation weighting. So it's a big part of their effort and it's going to be the first-line detail for that sales team. And we also wanted someone that was going to invest along with us. And as you saw, there's a willingness of Sunovion to invest $60 million over the first two years in not only people but also programs, marketing expenses in sample, etc. So in terms of the criteria that we laid out for the right partner, they met all the criteria for us. And so they're going to be very important for us in augmenting our primary care approach from that mid-decile to the high-decile prescribers.Ram Selvaraju -- H.C. Wainwright -- Analyst OK, great. And then with respect to the applicability of vibegron and IBS-associated pain, just wanted to get some clarity on what you folks expect to be the most critical secondary endpoints in the study from the vantage point of competitive positioning of the drug in this indication. And also, if you could elaborate on the pathway to formal approval in this indication, assuming that this study is positive, as well as how hypothetically vibegron would be positioned from a commercial standpoint vis-a-vis, for example, the way you allocate the sales effort, the commercial infrastructure with regard to this indication relative to the OAB indication. Thanks.Jim Robinson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Sure. So I'll let Cornelia add some color to this. But as you know, we've announced at the end of November, we expect to have the Phase 2a top-line results. At that point, we'll evaluate the Phase 2b/3 -- or Phase 2b/3 in combined development program requirements for our next step. In terms of utilizing the organization, there's two answers to that. Without question, we would utilize the existing sales and commercial infrastructure that we have. We find it to be extremely efficient. We would add potentially a little effort in the GI space as well, which would augment our already sizable sales organization. In terms of the other component is it allows for a differentiated label. So not only do we have a chance to differentiate the label in the U.S. but also abroad and would provide an opportunity to show that beyond the OAB indication, vibegron is effective. And let's say IBS pain, if successful, it also goes to speak to the development program we're doing in OAB and then with BPH. So either one of those indications provide for a significantly differentiated label in the U.S. and abroad. In terms of endpoints, in terms of primary and secondary, I'll let Cornelia handle that and maybe provide a little more color on the development programs, pending the outcome of the Phase 2a study that we'll get the readout on at the end of November. Cornelia?Cornelia Haag-Molkenteller -- Chief Medical Officer Yes. This is Cornelia. So again, it is like in all IBS studies. It is the reduction in the worst abdominal pain over the 12-week period. It's a 12-week study, double-blind, placebo-controlled. And again, as Jim said, this is a 75-milligram dose. So currently in the Phase 2a, we have studied one dose. If this continues, this program, we will probably have to study at least two doses. We will also be looking at no negative effects on stool consistency for IBS.Ram Selvaraju -- H.C. Wainwright -- Analyst OK. Perfect. And then just one very quick regarding DTC advertising.Cornelia Haag-Molkenteller -- Chief Medical Officer Sorry?Ram Selvaraju -- H.C. Wainwright -- Analyst Can you confirm that at that time that you expect vibegron to be launched, there's probably likely to be no significant or a tailing-off significance of counter detailing DTC presence of other OAB products as the vibegron class?Jim Robinson -- President and Chief Executive Officer I don't know if I could make a definitive statement on what another company will do with their DTC program. But what I can tell you is that we will have a multi-channel marketing campaign, as we've talked about previously, we expect to leverage digital and social channels. The evolution of the ability to reach people that are interested about learning more about overactive bladder has been significant. The ability to provide curated content on demand to people that are interested in learning more about how to talk to their doctor about it, as well as the potential products that are available significantly changed in the last five to 10 years. So we expect to be able to have a very successful and a very targeted direct-to-patient campaign launched sometime in 2021. So in terms of what other companies will do, I mean, I think we can only speculate.Ram Selvaraju -- H.C. Wainwright -- Analyst Thank you.Jim Robinson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you.OperatorThank you. [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Biren Amin with Jefferies. Your line is now open.Biren Amin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just on the vibegron potential approval. If you're approved later this month and with launch shortly thereafter, how should we think about the trajectory of the launch? Should we be looking at the vibegron TRx script count in the first few months of its launch and tracking to that?Jim Robinson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Hey, Biren, it's Jim. That's a good question. In terms of timing, again, the PDUFA date is December 26. We'll onboard our sales team over the course of January and February. We're interviewing them now, making contingent offers now. The offer would be effective upon the approval of vibegron. And so again, we do the onboarding and launching in the January, February time frame of that sales force with an expected launch in March, like we said, late 2021 -- or so late in the first quarter, excuse me, of 2021. In terms of the trajectory, as you probably know, the payer aspect is going to be important for us to be able to get access at launch. If I were to say, could you overlay the two launch curves? I think you're going to see that and vibegron's launch is going to be right from a standpoint of a trajectory similar, I would say, to mirabegron, probably slightly below until we have formulary access. But we do expect formulary access in the important plans, both in Part D and commercial in 2021 and early '22. And obviously, when we have formulary access at a critical mass, we expect that our launch trajectory will reflect that access and grow accordingly.Biren Amin -- Jefferies -- Analyst And so you talked about Part D. I guess is that component going to come through in 2022, Jim? Because that seems to take a little bit more time than the commercial payers.Jim Robinson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Generally, we said, 2021 bid cycles would have been in and reviewed at this point. So for us, without question, 2022 is an area of intense focus for Medicare Part D access. But beyond that, we still expect to get some access in Part D, and we expect some access in commercial. And as we've talked about previously, long-term care, we believe represents a significant opportunity for us to be able to provide access early in 2021 and be able to grow vibegron in that important segment of the market.Biren Amin -- Jefferies -- Analyst Great. Thanks for taking my questions.OperatorThank you. I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jim Robinson for closing remarks.Jim Robinson -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you very much, operator. And again, I want to thank all of those that have attended today's call and also want to thank those for the questions. And we look forward to providing you an update on our next call. Thanks very much.Operator[Operator signoff] Duration: 20 minutesCall participants:Ryan Kubota -- Investor RelationsJim Robinson -- President and Chief Executive OfficerCornelia Haag-Molkenteller -- Chief Medical OfficerAjay Bansal -- Chief Financial OfficerRam Selvaraju -- H.C.

        "article_text": " Extension study demonstrates favorable results in long term treatment of overactive bladder with vibegron, including improvements in incontinence efficacy, quality of life endpoints and with good tolerability   Long term EMPOWUR extension study data featured in an oral presentation at the virtual International Continence Society (ICS) Annual Meeting  Meta-analysis on increased risk of incident dementia following use of anticholinergics will also be presented at ICS Urovant Sciences (Nasdaq: UROV) today announced positive efficacy and safety data from the vibegron EMPOWUR long term extension study with patient data over a total exposure of 52 weeks. The data demonstrate that vibegron improved quality of life (QoL) and incontinence efficacy endpoints with good long term tolerability in adult patients with overactive bladder (OAB) and symptoms of urge urinary incontinence (UUI), urgency and urinary frequency.\r\n Vibegron is a once-daily, beta-3 adrenergic agonist under investigation for the treatment of OAB by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In March 2020, the FDA accepted the New Drug Application (NDA) for vibegron in OAB and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of December 26, 2020.\r\n In an oral presentation at the virtual International Continence Society (ICS) Annual Meeting, David Staskin, MD, presented results from the 40-week EMPOWUR extension to the 12-week EMPOWUR trial that show 75 mg of vibegron was well tolerated over the total exposure of 52 weeks and demonstrated numerically greater improvements from baseline compared with tolterodine across QoL and responder efficacy endpoints. These results are consistent with the results from the placebo-controlled EMPOWUR phase 3 study, with comparable safety and durable efficacy.\r\n \"A large segment of the OAB population suffers in silence because they are embarrassed, afraid, or unaware that there are treatments, including medications, that could address their problems with bladder control. This situation leads to OAB being overlooked and undertreated, and highlights the need for therapeutic options to improve quality of life,\" said Dr. Staskin, principal investigator of the EMPOWUR study, leading urologist with St. Elizabeth's Medical Center, and Associate Professor of Urology at Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston. \"The EMPOWUR 40-week extension study demonstrated how vibegron, if approved by the FDA, has the potential to offer a lasting solution for adult patients with OAB to manage urinary frequency and urinary incontinence associated with the urgent need to go to the bathroom.\"\r\n At week 52, 61 percent of 143 vibegron-treated patients had a =75 percent reduction and 40.8 percent showed a 100 percent reduction in UUI (urge urinary incontinence), a key symptom for OAB patients. In addition, 71.1 percent had =50 percent reduction in total incontinence episodes from baseline to week 52. In this same time period, vibegron demonstrated numerically greater improvements from baseline versus tolterodine for all QoL subscale scores as measured by the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire Long Form (OAB-qLF), including coping, concern, sleep, social interaction, health-related QoL and symptom bother. Vibegron 75 mg once daily demonstrated a 40-week safety profile comparable to that of 12-week EMPOWUR study, as well as durable efficacy for QoL and incontinence efficacy endpoints. Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 62.6% (171/273) of vibegron and 54.3% (126/232) of tolterodine patients; 4 (1.5%) vibegron and 8 (3.4%) tolterodine patients discontinued study medication due to an AE.\r\n  Examining the Risk of Cognitive Effects Associated with Anticholinergic Agents  On November 20, there will be a presentation of findings from a recent meta-analysis of anticholinergic use by Dr. Roger Dmochowski, which was supported by Urovant. The systemic literature review and meta-analysis revealed that use of anticholinergic agents for three months or longer increased the risk of incident dementia by an average of 46 percent relative to non-use. This increased risk also was reported in the six studies included in the meta-analysis that evaluated anticholinergic medications used to treat overactive bladder.\r\n Anticholinergic medications are currently the most frequently prescribed pharmaceutical treatment for OAB. They exert their effects by blocking the action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and are prescribed to treat a wide range of medical conditions.\r\n \"The findings from our systematic literature review and meta-analysis shine a light on what data and anecdotal evidence has demonstrated for many practicing physicians: ongoing use of anticholinergics to treat OAB comes with an increased risk,\" said Dr. Dmochowski, associate surgeon in chief and Professor of Urologic Surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \"These findings underscore the need for medicines that can treat conditions such as OAB without the potential cognitive risks associated with anticholinergic agents. It is essential that health care providers work with their patients to determine an appropriate treatment plan.\"\r\n  About Urovant Sciences Urovant Sciences is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies for urologic conditions. The Company's lead product candidate, vibegron, is an oral, once-daily small molecule beta-3 agonist that is being evaluated for overactive bladder (OAB).

        "article_text": "NASDAQ:UROV levelled off on Monday after a historic rise during Friday\u2019s trading session when it was announced that the Irvine, California based biotech firm would be bought out by Sumitovant Biopharma. Shares skyrocketed on Friday by nearly 100%, but on Monday, the stock remained relatively flat gaining only 0.12% to close the day at $16.04. The stock probably will not move much off these price levels as the proposed deal would payout existing shareholders $16.25 for each share, if and when the deal is ultimately approved. The current price of the stock represents an all-time high price for Urovant, so patient investors have finally received good news after years of relatively flat trading. Sumitovant Biopharma is Urovant\u2019s largest shareholder, owning nearly 73% of Urovant\u2019s outstanding shares. The New York-based biotech company is actually a merger between Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma and Roivant Sciences, hence the name Sumitovant. The proposed deal will actually take Urovant off of the publicly traded markets as Sumitovant is a privately owned company. One of the reasons for Sumitovant\u2019s aggressive buyout is for Vibegron, a treatment for overactive bladders that is coming down Urovant\u2019s pipeline. The drug is set to be submitted to the FDA for approval by the end of December, and if approved, should be a key piece of Sumitovant\u2019s product list moving forward.\u00a0  So with the pending buyout, Urovant\u2019s short-lived life as a publicly-traded company should soon come to an end. The surge on Friday was the most exciting thing to happen to this stock since its inception in 2018, and now Urovant looks like it will become a member of the growing biotech conglomerate that is Sumitovant.\u00a0 \r\n                    Information on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Log in to your account Don't have a Benzinga account? Create one The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's\u00a0approval machinery churned out a lot of disappointments in November. Most of the negative verdicts were tied to difficulties the agency has had in inspecting facilities where investigational drugs are being manufactured, amid COVID-19-related restrictions. Supernus Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ: SUPN), Alkermes Plc (NASDAQ: ALKS), Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corp (NASDAQ: ADMP), Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE: BMY), Liquidia Technologies Inc (NASDAQ: LQDA) and Revance Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ: RVNC) were among the companies that either received complete response\u00a0letters (which indicate\u00a0that the application is not ready for approval) or saw the review periods extended. Notable among the approvals issued during the month were Eiger Biopharmaceuticals Inc's (NASDAQ: EIGR)  progeria treatment Zokinvy  and Sanofi SA's (NASDAQ: SNY) sutimlimab for treating hemolysis in adult patients with cold agglutinin disease. Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALNY) was fortunate to get the FDA nod for its Oxlumo drug to treat primary hyperoxaluria type 1, ahead of the Dec. 3 PDUFA date. New molecular entity approvals totaled 44 thus far this year, compared to 41 approvals in the same period last year. Here are are the key PDUFA dates for December: Company:  Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s (NASDAQ: VNDA)\nType of Application: NDA & sNDA\nCandidate:  Hetlioz\nIndication:  Smith-Magenis Syndrome\nDate:  Dec. 1 Hetlioz, a melatonin receptor agonist, was approved in Jan. 2014 to treat non\u201424-hour sleep-wake disorder in totally blind individuals. Vanda is now seeking an expansion to the label to include Hetlioz capsules. The company has also filed a new drug appication\u00a0for the liquid formulation of Hetlioz for the treatment of Smith-Magenis Syndrome. Smith-Magenis Syndrome is a developmental disorder that is caused by a small deletion of human chromosome 17p, or in rare cases, due to a point mutation in the RAI1 gene which resides in the deleted region. This is estimated to affect one in about 15,200 to 25,000 people in the U.S. The most common symptom is a severe sleep disorder associated with significant disruption in the lives of patients and their families. Incidentally, Hetlioz faced a rejection as a treatment option for jet lag disorder in mid-2019. Company:  BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: BCRX)\nType of Application:  NDA\nCandidate:  berotralstat, codenamed BCX7353\nIndication:  hereditary angioedema, or HAE, attacks\nDate:  Dec. 3 Berotralstat, which would go by the brand name Orladeyo, is being evaluated as an oral, once-daily treatment for the prevention of HAE attacks. HAE is an inherited condition characterized by recurrent episodes of nonpruritic, nonpitting, subcutaneous or submucosal swelling without the presence of urticarial lesions. It is caused by a low level or improper function of a protein called the C1 inhibitor and affects the blood vessels. The company expects Orladeyo to fill an important unmet need for an oral HAE prophylactic and generate more than $500 million in global sales, Needham analyst Serge Belanger said in a recent note. \"While we see no significant reason to doubt the FDA approval of Orladeyo by its PDUFA date, we remain skeptical of the product's overall potential given significantly lower efficacy levels (~44% attack rate reduction in ph 3 trials) vs. current injectable therapies with 80%-90% efficacy,\" the analyst said. Company:  MacroGenics Inc (NASDAQ: MGNX) & Zai Lab Ltd \u2013 ADR (NASDAQ: ZLAB)\nType of Application:  BLA\nCandidate:  margetuximab\nIndication:  Breast cancer\nDate:  Dec. 18 Margetuximab, a Fc-engineered, anti-HER2 mAb, is being evaluated in combination with chemotherapy for treating patients with with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. MacroGenics has partnered with Zai Lab in Greater China for the indication. Company:  Amgen, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMGN)/ AbbVie Inc (NYSE: ABBV)\nType of Application:  BLA\nCandidate:  ABP 798\nIndication:  Cancer\nDate:  Dec. 19 ABP 798 is a biosimilar candidate to Roche Holdings AG's Basel ADR Common Stock (OTC: RHHBY) Rituxan. Rituxan is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, which has been approved for many indications, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis with glucocorticoids. The active ingredient of ABP 798 is a monoclonal antibody with the same amino acid sequence as Rituxan. Related Link:  Biotech Stocks With Material Catalysts In Q4  Company:  FibroGen Inc (NASDAQ: FGEN) & AstraZeneca plc (NASDAQ: AZN)\nType of Application:  NDA\nCandidate:  roxadustat\nIndication:  anemia of chronic kidney disease\nDate:  Dec. 20 Roxadustat is an orally administered, small molecule HIF-PH inhibitor that promotes erythropoiesis, which is the process of producing red blood cells or erythrocytes. The NDA seeks approval of roxadustat for the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease, in both non-dialysis-dependent and dialysis-dependent patients. Fibrogen is collaborating with AstraZeneca on the development and commercialization of roxadustat for the treatment of anemia in the U.S., China\u00a0and other markets in the Americas and in Australia, New Zealand and\u00a0Southeast Asia. Company:  Myovant Sciences Ltd (NYSE: MYOV)\nType of Application:  NDA\nCandidate:  relugolix\nIndication:  prostate cancer\nDate:  Dec. 20 In late June, the FDA accepted for priority review the NDA for once-daily, oral relugolix, 120 mg, for the treatment of men with advanced prostate cancer. Relugolix is an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor antagonist that reduces production of testicular testosterone, a hormone known to stimulate the growth of prostate cancer, and ovarian estradiol, a hormone known to stimulate the growth of uterine fibroids and endometriosis. Company:  Urovant Sciences Ltd (NASDAQ: UROV)\nType of Application:  NDA\nCandidate:  vibegron\nIndication:  overactive bladder\nDate:  Dec. 26 The FDA accepted the NDA for a review March 5, with the regulatory filing seeking approval for once-daily 75 mg vibegron for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency\u00a0and urinary frequency. Company:  Viatris Inc (NASDAQ: VTRS)\nType of Application:  BLA\nCandidate:  MYL-1402O\nIndication:  Multiple cancer types\nDate:  Dec. 27 Viatris, which formed following the merger of the erstwhile generic pharma company Mylan and Pfizer Inc.'s (NYSE: PFE) generic unit Upjohn, has a tryst with the FDA in late December. The regulatory agency is scheduled to rule on the BLA for MYL-1402O, a proposed alternative\u00a0to Roche's Avastin, for review under the 351(k) pathway. This is being developed in partnership with India's Biocon. The BLA seeks approval of MYL-1402O for first-line and second-line treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with fluorouracil-based chemotherapy; first-line use for patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer; recurrent glioblastoma; metastatic renal cell carcinoma in combination with interferon alfa; and persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. Company:  Osmotica Pharmaceuticals PLC (NASDAQ: OSMT)\nType of Application:  NDA\nCandidate:  Ontinua (arbaclofen) ER\nIndication:  spasticity in patients with MS\nDate:  Dec. 29 Osmotica originally submitted the NDA for arbaclofen ER in 2015, with the FDA issuing a complete response in June 2016, citing irregularities and deviations from good clinical practices at study sites of the initial Phase 3 trial. The company submitted in late June an amended NDA, and in late July, it said the regulatory agency had deemed its submission as a complete, class 2 response. \"Management noted that the questions received from FDA so far have been reasonable and confirmatory in nature, and that it feels very good about its answers to the agency's information requests,\" SVB Leerink analyst Ami Fadia said in a recent note. \"All in all, it clearly sees great potential in arbaclofen, but is cautiously optimistic on the approval given the history of the product.\" Company:  Scpharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ: SCPH)\nType of Application:  NDA\nCandidate:  Furoscix\nIndication:  worsening heart failure due to congestion\nDate:  Dec. 30 Furoscix is a proprietary, subcutaneously-delivered furosemide solution, as an outpatient alternative for the treatment of worsening congestive\u00a0heart failure. This is scPharma's second try for Furoscix following a CRL issued in 2018, wherein the agency sought additional human factor\u00a0studies, device modifications\u00a0and potentially a clinical validation study. The PDUFA event is a significant catalyst for the stock, SVB Leerink analyst Fadia said. The analyst said she is cautiously optimistic on the approval, given the regulatory history, and put an 80% probability of success on approval. If approved, the analyst models a price target for $20 for the shares. Company:  Athenex Inc (NASDAQ: ATNX)\nType of Application:  NDA\nCandidate:  tirbanibulin ointment\nIndication:  actinic keratosis\nDate:  Dec. 30 The NDA for tirbanibulin ointment was accepted for review March 9. Athenex has granted Almirall, S.A., an exclusive license for R&D and commercializing tirbanibulin ointment in the U.S. and European countries, including Russia. Actinic Keratosis is the most common pre-cancerous condition in dermatology and affects more than 55 million Americans, and accounts for between 14-29% of dermatologist visits in the U.S., Athenex said. Company:  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ: VRTX)\nType of Application:  sNDAs\nCandidate:  Trikafta (elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor), Symdeko (tezacaftor and ivacaftor) and Kalydeco (ivacaftor)\nIndication:  cystic fibrosis\nDate:  Dec. 30 The sNDAs were accepted by the FDA for review Sept. 1. These regulatory submissions are intended to expand the labels for Trikafta, Symdeko and Kalydeco to include additional rare CFTR mutations, Vertex said. Potential approvals will also allow certain people with cystic fibrosis, who are currently eligible for Kalydeco to become eligible for Symdeko or Trikafta and certain people currently eligible for Symdeko tp become eligible for Trikafta, it added. The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, or VRBPAC, will meet Dec. 10, in an open session to discuss emergency use authorization of the vaccine candidate developed by Pfizer-BioNTech SE \u2013 ADR (NASDAQ: BNTX) for the prevention of COVID-19 in individuals 16 years of age and older. The companies  filed with the FDA an application for EUA  Nov. 20. Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA) is also likely to meet with VRBPAC once it mandated safety data is accrued and it files for EUA.
