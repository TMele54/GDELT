Dr Ayman Al-Hendy The drug was also well tolerated, with retention of bone mineral density and no new adverse events, said Ayman Al-Hendy, MD, PhD, who presented the results October 17 at the virtual American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) 2020 Scientific Congress. \"Relugolix combination therapy represents a potential long-term treatment for women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids,\" said Al-Hendy, a gynecologist and endoscopic surgeon at the University of Chicago, in Illinois. Al-Hendy, who consults for the company that makes the drug, on October 20 presented results showing improvement in quality of life with relugolix therapy. \"The fact that this longer-term study shows continued, persistent results at a year really gives us confidence that we'll be able to use these drugs as a long-term therapy to treat fibroids,\" Hugh S. Taylor, MD, president-elect of ASRM, told Medscape Medical News. Taylor, a professor and chair of ob-gyn and reproductive sciences at the Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, was not involved in the study. \"A drug like this is so necessary,\" Taylor continued. \"We don't have any other drugs on the market approved for long-term use.\" Relugolix is an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist under investigation for long-term management of uterine fibroids. The once-daily combination therapy includes 40 mg relugolix, 1 mg estradiol, and 0.5 mg norethindrone acetate. The extension trial enrolled women aged 18 to 50 years who were experiencing heavy menstrual bleeding from uterine fibroids and who completed the 24-week phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled LIBERTY 1 or 2 trials. Heavy menstrual bleeding was defined as bleeding in which at least 80 mL of blood was lost per cycle for two cycles or 160 mL was lost during one cycle. Ultrasound imaging was used to confirm the presence of fibroids. In LIBERTY 1 and 2, women were randomly assigned to receive relugolix combination therapy, placebo, or relugolix alone for 12 weeks followed by combination therapy for the remaining 12 weeks (delayed group). Those trials found that relugolix combination therapy was effective through 6 months in reducing menstrual blood loss and pain in women with uterine fibroids without loss of bone mineral density. LIBERTY 3 extended the trial to 52 weeks, with all participants receiving relugolix combination therapy. As in the earlier trials, the primary endpoint was reduced menstrual blood loss. By the end of the study, women needed to have at least a 50% reduction in blood loss from the initial study's baseline while maintaining a blood loss of <80 mL. The investigators also evaluated the mean percentage of menstrual blood loss reduction, amenorrhea rate, and improvements in anemia as secondary endpoints and assessed changes in bone mineral density. The extension study enrolled 78% (n = 477) of the 610 women who completed the initial study; of those, 363 women completed the extension study. Among the 163 women who began with relugolix combination therapy in the first two trials, 87.7% met the primary endpoint in a per-protocol analysis through week 52. The proportion of responders in the extension study was 75.6% among the group that formerly received placebo (n = 164) and 79.9% in the delayed group (n = 149). The overall average reduction in menstrual blood volume was 89.9%. Most of the women experienced amenorrhea at the end of the year: 70.6% in the relugolix group, 57.9% in the group that formerly received placebo, and 68.5% in the delayed group. Reductions in uterine volume and uterine fibroid volume were also sustained from week 24 through week 52. For the relugolix combination therapy group, the mean loss of uterine fibroid volume from baseline was 13.5% at week 24 and 18.3% at week 52. Similarly, the delayed group's average loss in fibroid volume was 28.1% at week 24 and 33.9% at week 52. The placebo group, which only had a 7% loss in fibroid volume at week 24, had an 18.4% loss in volume from baseline at week 52. Among patients with anemia, defined as hemoglobin concentrations of <10.5 g/dL at baseline, 59% of those in the original relugolix group saw an improvement of at least 2 g/dL hemoglobin. The women's improvement in pain symptoms also continued through week 52, with a 51.3-point reduction in scores on the bleeding pain and discomfort scale from baseline to the end of the study. Adverse events were the same in the extension study and in the initial study. Those most commonly reported were headache and hot flashes. No serious safety signals occurred. The average reduction in bone mineral density was 0.80% at week 52, indicating no concerning loss. Relugolix is one of three GnRH antagonists being studied for the long-term treatment of fibroids. The US Food and Drug Administration approved the combination of elagolix, estradiol, and norethindrone acetate (Oriahnn) in May. Linzagolix, another GnRH antagonist, is currently in clinical trials. \"We'll have a whole class of new drugs that are likely to fulfill this long sought-after goal of reducing the need for surgery for fibroids and doing it without a lot of side effects,\" Taylor said. \"The quality-of-life improvements seen here, the lack of significant adverse effects \u2014 none that were surprising in long term \u2014 the relatively low reduction in bone mineral density in a year are all very exciting [and suggest] that this will be a safe and effective long-term treatment.\" In the presentation on quality of life with relugolix therapy, Al-Hendy shared results regarding the severity of women's symptoms as well as health-related quality of life, as determined on the basis of the Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Health-Related Quality of Life (UFS-QoL) questionnaire at baseline, week 12, and week 24 in LIBERTY 1 and 2. Higher UFS-QoL scores correlate with more severe symptoms. With the subscale of health-related quality of life, higher scores indicate a better quality of life. The substudy enrolled 253 patients who received relugolix combination therapy and 256 patients who received placebo. The average menstrual blood loss was 243 mL in the relugolix group and 215 mL in the placebo group at baseline. Mean fibroid volume was the same in both groups at baseline, 73 cm3. The proportion of Black patients was similar in both groups: 48% of the relugolix group and 54% of the placebo group. The severity of women's symptoms dropped from a baseline UFS-QoL score of 57 to 22.4 at 6 months among those who received relugolix combination therapy. In the placebo group, the initial score of 59.6 only dropped to 46.9 (P < .0001, for \u201321.4 difference in change). Health-related quality of life increased from 38.3 to 76.6 among those who received relugolix. In the placebo group, it increased from 35.7 to 48.2 (P < .0001, for 24.5 difference). Subscales of health-related quality of life \u2014 including concern, control, activities, energy/mood, self-consciousness, and sexual function \u2014 also all improved significantly in the relugolix group compared with the placebo group (P < .0001). \"This is a condition we see all the time that's easily diagnosed, and we have first-line drugs we've been using to treat them, but none are good long-term fixes,\" Taylor said. The current first-line treatments, oral contraceptives, can stabilize bleeding, he continued, \"but they don't make the fibroids shrink, they don't stop the bleeding, women continue to have breakthrough bleeding, and the fibroids can continue to grow.\" He said most of the estimated 600,000 hysterectomies performed in the United States each year are for uterine fibroids. \"It's a major surgery that no one wants to go through if they don't have to,\" Taylor said. \"Here we have a drug that really has potential to stop the growth of the fibroids, that can stop the bleeding or dramatically improve it, and, really, for the first time, directly impact the fibroids and give us a long-term alternative.\"  The studies were funded by Myovant Sciences GmbH. Al-Hendy reported consulting for AbbVie, Bayer, and Myovant Sciences\u00a0and he owns a patent for novel diagnostics and therapeutics for uterine sarcoma. Taylor has disclosed no relevant financial relationships.   American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) 2020 Scientific Congress: Abstract O-1 and O-205, presented October 17 and 20, 2020.

        "article_text": "\nPosted by: GlobeNewswire \nin Top News\nSeptember 14, 2020\n BASEL, Switzerland, Sept. 14, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) \u2014 Myovant Sciences (NYSE: MYOV), a healthcare company focused on redefining care for women and for men, today announced the presentation of one-year data on bone mineral density (BMD) from the Phase 3 LIBERTY program evaluating the safety and efficacy of once-daily relugolix combination therapy (relugolix 40 mg plus estradiol 1.0 mg and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) in women with uterine fibroids. The BMD results from the LIBERTY program demonstrated maintenance of BMD through one year and were consistent with those observed in a separate prospective observational study of untreated, age-matched women with uterine fibroids. The findings were presented at the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) 2020 Annual Meeting Virtual Event, held September 11-15, 2020. \u201cUterine fibroids are a chronic condition, but the duration of use for existing treatment options has been limited by concerns about potential bone loss while on therapy,\u201d said Michael McClung, M.D., founding director of the Oregon Osteoporosis Center. \u201cThese new data show relugolix combination therapy maintained bone mineral density over one year of treatment, consistent with that of untreated, age-matched women with uterine fibroids in a concurrent study.\u201d \u201cWe believe these findings add to the unique and growing evidence supporting relugolix combination tablet as a potential long-term treatment option for women with uterine fibroids,\u201d said Juan Camilo Arjona Ferreira, M.D., chief medical officer of\u00a0Myovant Sciences. \u201cThese data further support our vision of providing a one pill, once-a-day treatment that may provide substantial reductions in menstrual blood loss and symptom relief while maintaining bone health.\u201d Details of the presentations are as follows: Relugolix Combination Therapy Preserves Bone Mass in Patients with Uterine Fibroids: Results from Phase 3 LIBERTY Program (Abstract # P-641)The Phase 3 LIBERTY program evaluated the safety and efficacy of once-daily relugolix combination therapy in premenopausal women with heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids. The program met its primary endpoints and demonstrated that relugolix combination therapy significantly reduced menstrual blood loss and pain. In this analysis, pooled data from 768 women in the LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2 studies showed that mean changes in lumbar spine bone mineral density (LS BMD) were comparable for relugolix combination therapy and placebo (Week 12: -0.63% vs. 0.34%; Week 24: -0.23% vs. 0.18%, respectively). Evaluation of Relugolix Combination Therapy to Maintain Bone Mass in Women with Uterine Fibroids Through 52 Weeks: LIBERTY Long-Term Extension Study (Abstract # P-639)Eligible women who completed the LIBERTY 1 or LIBERTY 2 studies were offered the opportunity to enroll in an active treatment extension study in which all women received relugolix combination therapy for an additional 28-week period, for a total treatment period of up to 52 weeks. In this analysis, data from 163 women who entered the extension study after receiving 24 weeks of relugolix combination therapy demonstrated maintenance of BMD through 52 weeks of treatment (Week 52: LS BMD -0.80%). A Prospective Observational Study of Bone Mineral Density in Premenopausal Women with Uterine Fibroids (Abstract # P-552)This prospective observational study was designed to characterize longitudinal BMD in 262 premenopausal women with uterine fibroids. Mean LS BMD showed minimal changes over the 52-week observational period (0% at Week 24 and -0.41% at Week 52). Relugolix combination tablet is under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of women with uterine fibroids, with a target action date of June 1, 2021. Myovant submitted a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency in March 2020 for relugolix combination tablet in uterine fibroids. Additionally, relugolix (120 mg) is under Priority Review by the FDA for the treatment of men with advanced prostate cancer, with a target action date of December 20, 2020. Myovant has also reported positive data from two replicate Phase 3 studies evaluating relugolix combination therapy in women with endometriosis. About the Phase 3 LIBERTY Program in Uterine FibroidsMyovant\u2019s Phase 3 clinical program for uterine fibroids consisted of two multinational, replicate pivotal clinical studies (LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2) of relugolix combination therapy (relugolix 40 mg plus estradiol 1.0 mg and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) in women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids for 24 weeks. Eligible women who completed the LIBERTY 1 or LIBERTY 2 studies were offered the opportunity to enroll in an active treatment extension study in which all women received relugolix combination therapy for an additional 28-week period for a total treatment period of 52 weeks, designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of longer-term treatment. Upon completion of this 52-week total treatment period, eligible women could elect to participate in a second 52-week randomized withdrawal study designed to provide two-year safety and efficacy data on relugolix combination therapy and to evaluate the need for maintenance therapy. Across studies, a response was defined as a menstrual blood loss volume of less than 80 mL and a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in menstrual blood loss volume during the last 35 days of treatment measured using the alkaline hematin method. LIBERTY 1 and 2 met the primary endpoint (p < 0.0001) with 73.4% and 71.2% of women receiving relugolix combination therapy achieving the responder criteria compared with 18.9% and 14.7% of women receiving placebo at 24 weeks, respectively. On average, women receiving relugolix combination therapy in both studies experienced an 84.3% reduction in menstrual blood loss from baseline (p < 0.0001). Bone mineral density was comparable between the relugolix combination therapy and placebo groups in LIBERTY 1 and 2. The distribution of the change in bone mineral density, including outliers, was similar for the relugolix combination therapy and placebo groups at 24 weeks, as assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The overall incidence of adverse events in the relugolix combination and placebo groups was comparable in both studies. The open-label extension study also met the primary endpoint with relugolix combination therapy demonstrating an 87.7% response rate at one year, showing the durability of the response observed in LIBERTY 1 and 2. In addition, women experienced, on average, an 89.9% reduction in menstrual blood loss from baseline. Changes in bone mineral density through one year, as assessed by DXA every three months, were consistent with LIBERTY 1 and 2. The incidence of adverse events over one year was consistent with that observed in LIBERTY 1 and 2, with no new safety signals observed. About Uterine FibroidsUterine fibroids are noncancerous tumors that develop in or on the muscular walls of the uterus and are among the most common reproductive tract tumors in women. In addition to an individual\u2019s genetic predisposition, estrogens are well known to play an important role in the regulation of fibroid growth. Although uterine fibroids are benign tumors, they can cause debilitating symptoms such as heavy menstrual bleeding (frequently resulting in anemia and fatigue), pain (including painful periods, abdominal pain, painful intercourse, backache), increased abdominal girth and bloating, urinary frequency or retention, constipation, pregnancy loss, and, in some cases, infertility. These symptoms can also lead to loss of productivity at work, limitations in normal activities of daily living, and social embarrassment. An estimated five million women in the U.S. suffer from symptoms of uterine fibroids, and an estimated three million women are inadequately treated by current medical therapy and require further treatment. About RelugolixRelugolix is a once-daily, oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist that reduces ovarian estradiol, a hormone known to stimulate the growth of uterine fibroids and endometriosis, and testicular testosterone, a hormone known to stimulate the growth of prostate cancer.\u00a0Relugolix combination tablet (relugolix 40 mg, estradiol 1.0 mg, and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) is under regulatory review in\u00a0Europe\u00a0and the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0for women with uterine fibroids and is under development for women with endometriosis.\u00a0Relugolix monotherapy tablet (120 mg) is under regulatory review in the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0for men with advanced prostate cancer.

The program will provide funding to nonprofit healthcare organizations with innovative projects focused on improving healthcare access, with an initial focus on reducing racial disparities in prostate cancer and uterine fibroids in the U.S. Myovant will award as many as four grants of up to $50,000 each, for a total of $200,000. Prostate cancer is the second deadliest cancer in men in the U.S. and has the largest racial disparity of any major cancer, killing Black men twice as often as white men. Uterine fibroids can cause debilitating symptoms such as heavy menstrual bleeding and pain, leading to over 250,000 hysterectomies each year in the U.S., with Black women more likely to undergo more invasive surgical procedures. Studies have also shown that Black men and women have less access to healthcare, and access issues such as lack of insurance coverage have been shown to contribute to the racial disparities in prostate cancer and uterine fibroids. \"Myovant is committed to redefining care for women and for men, not only through the development of new medicines but also through initiatives that aim to address the broader societal issues that lead to health inequities,\" said Jarrad Aguirre, M.D., head of corporate strategy and advocacy at Myovant Sciences. \"We have forged multiple cross-sector partnerships to advocate for a world in which everyone can move forward on their journey with confidence and health, and we are proud to expand our commitment with the launch of the Forward for Health Equity grant program.\" Myovant previously launched the Female Forward Together coalition in partnership with Evidation Health, Flo Health, HealthyWomen, and PERIOD, with coalition projects including the development of a digital tool to evaluate menstrual blood loss and the creation of a storytelling initiative to reduce stigma around menstruation. Myovant also recently launched the Forward Momentum coalition in partnership with BlackDoctor.org, Evidation Health, and Movember to improve representation of Black men and women in research studies and to develop digital tools for men with prostate cancer. \"Prostate cancer and uterine fibroids have a disproportionate impact on Black men and women, and studies have shown those populations may experience worse outcomes from these diseases due to societal inequities and disparities in healthcare access,\" said Reggie Ware, chief executive officer of BlackDoctor.org. \"These disparities have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, making an effort like Myovant's Forward for Health Equity grant program an urgent priority and an important initiative.\" The \"Forward for Health Equity\" grant program will accept applications through December 31, 2020. Applicants must be U.S.-based nonprofit healthcare organizations. Applicants may not be individual healthcare professionals. Applications will be evaluated based on 1) greatest potential to improve health equity, 2) degree of innovation, and 3) focus on healthcare access. Applications will be reviewed by a committee consisting of Myovant employees and external leaders and advocates.

Log in to your account Don't have a Benzinga account? Create one The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's\u00a0approval machinery churned out a lot of disappointments in November. Most of the negative verdicts were tied to difficulties the agency has had in inspecting facilities where investigational drugs are being manufactured, amid COVID-19-related restrictions. Supernus Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ: SUPN), Alkermes Plc (NASDAQ: ALKS), Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corp (NASDAQ: ADMP), Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE: BMY), Liquidia Technologies Inc (NASDAQ: LQDA) and Revance Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ: RVNC) were among the companies that either received complete response\u00a0letters (which indicate\u00a0that the application is not ready for approval) or saw the review periods extended. Notable among the approvals issued during the month were Eiger Biopharmaceuticals Inc's (NASDAQ: EIGR)  progeria treatment Zokinvy  and Sanofi SA's (NASDAQ: SNY) sutimlimab for treating hemolysis in adult patients with cold agglutinin disease. Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALNY) was fortunate to get the FDA nod for its Oxlumo drug to treat primary hyperoxaluria type 1, ahead of the Dec. 3 PDUFA date. New molecular entity approvals totaled 44 thus far this year, compared to 41 approvals in the same period last year. Here are are the key PDUFA dates for December: Company:  Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s (NASDAQ: VNDA)\nType of Application: NDA & sNDA\nCandidate:  Hetlioz\nIndication:  Smith-Magenis Syndrome\nDate:  Dec. 1 Hetlioz, a melatonin receptor agonist, was approved in Jan. 2014 to treat non\u201424-hour sleep-wake disorder in totally blind individuals. Vanda is now seeking an expansion to the label to include Hetlioz capsules. The company has also filed a new drug appication\u00a0for the liquid formulation of Hetlioz for the treatment of Smith-Magenis Syndrome. Smith-Magenis Syndrome is a developmental disorder that is caused by a small deletion of human chromosome 17p, or in rare cases, due to a point mutation in the RAI1 gene which resides in the deleted region. This is estimated to affect one in about 15,200 to 25,000 people in the U.S. The most common symptom is a severe sleep disorder associated with significant disruption in the lives of patients and their families. Incidentally, Hetlioz faced a rejection as a treatment option for jet lag disorder in mid-2019. Company:  BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: BCRX)\nType of Application:  NDA\nCandidate:  berotralstat, codenamed BCX7353\nIndication:  hereditary angioedema, or HAE, attacks\nDate:  Dec. 3 Berotralstat, which would go by the brand name Orladeyo, is being evaluated as an oral, once-daily treatment for the prevention of HAE attacks. HAE is an inherited condition characterized by recurrent episodes of nonpruritic, nonpitting, subcutaneous or submucosal swelling without the presence of urticarial lesions. It is caused by a low level or improper function of a protein called the C1 inhibitor and affects the blood vessels. The company expects Orladeyo to fill an important unmet need for an oral HAE prophylactic and generate more than $500 million in global sales, Needham analyst Serge Belanger said in a recent note. \"While we see no significant reason to doubt the FDA approval of Orladeyo by its PDUFA date, we remain skeptical of the product's overall potential given significantly lower efficacy levels (~44% attack rate reduction in ph 3 trials) vs. current injectable therapies with 80%-90% efficacy,\" the analyst said. Company:  MacroGenics Inc (NASDAQ: MGNX) & Zai Lab Ltd \u2013 ADR (NASDAQ: ZLAB)\nType of Application:  BLA\nCandidate:  margetuximab\nIndication:  Breast cancer\nDate:  Dec. 18 Margetuximab, a Fc-engineered, anti-HER2 mAb, is being evaluated in combination with chemotherapy for treating patients with with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. MacroGenics has partnered with Zai Lab in Greater China for the indication. Company:  Amgen, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMGN)/ AbbVie Inc (NYSE: ABBV)\nType of Application:  BLA\nCandidate:  ABP 798\nIndication:  Cancer\nDate:  Dec. 19 ABP 798 is a biosimilar candidate to Roche Holdings AG's Basel ADR Common Stock (OTC: RHHBY) Rituxan. Rituxan is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, which has been approved for many indications, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis with glucocorticoids. The active ingredient of ABP 798 is a monoclonal antibody with the same amino acid sequence as Rituxan. Related Link:  Biotech Stocks With Material Catalysts In Q4  Company:  FibroGen Inc (NASDAQ: FGEN) & AstraZeneca plc (NASDAQ: AZN)\nType of Application:  NDA\nCandidate:  roxadustat\nIndication:  anemia of chronic kidney disease\nDate:  Dec. 20 Roxadustat is an orally administered, small molecule HIF-PH inhibitor that promotes erythropoiesis, which is the process of producing red blood cells or erythrocytes. The NDA seeks approval of roxadustat for the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease, in both non-dialysis-dependent and dialysis-dependent patients. Fibrogen is collaborating with AstraZeneca on the development and commercialization of roxadustat for the treatment of anemia in the U.S., China\u00a0and other markets in the Americas and in Australia, New Zealand and\u00a0Southeast Asia. Company:  Myovant Sciences Ltd (NYSE: MYOV)\nType of Application:  NDA\nCandidate:  relugolix\nIndication:  prostate cancer\nDate:  Dec. 20 In late June, the FDA accepted for priority review the NDA for once-daily, oral relugolix, 120 mg, for the treatment of men with advanced prostate cancer. Relugolix is an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor antagonist that reduces production of testicular testosterone, a hormone known to stimulate the growth of prostate cancer, and ovarian estradiol, a hormone known to stimulate the growth of uterine fibroids and endometriosis. Company:  Urovant Sciences Ltd (NASDAQ: UROV)\nType of Application:  NDA\nCandidate:  vibegron\nIndication:  overactive bladder\nDate:  Dec. 26 The FDA accepted the NDA for a review March 5, with the regulatory filing seeking approval for once-daily 75 mg vibegron for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency\u00a0and urinary frequency. Company:  Viatris Inc (NASDAQ: VTRS)\nType of Application:  BLA\nCandidate:  MYL-1402O\nIndication:  Multiple cancer types\nDate:  Dec. 27 Viatris, which formed following the merger of the erstwhile generic pharma company Mylan and Pfizer Inc.'s (NYSE: PFE) generic unit Upjohn, has a tryst with the FDA in late December. The regulatory agency is scheduled to rule on the BLA for MYL-1402O, a proposed alternative\u00a0to Roche's Avastin, for review under the 351(k) pathway. This is being developed in partnership with India's Biocon. The BLA seeks approval of MYL-1402O for first-line and second-line treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with fluorouracil-based chemotherapy; first-line use for patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer; recurrent glioblastoma; metastatic renal cell carcinoma in combination with interferon alfa; and persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. Company:  Osmotica Pharmaceuticals PLC (NASDAQ: OSMT)\nType of Application:  NDA\nCandidate:  Ontinua (arbaclofen) ER\nIndication:  spasticity in patients with MS\nDate:  Dec. 29 Osmotica originally submitted the NDA for arbaclofen ER in 2015, with the FDA issuing a complete response in June 2016, citing irregularities and deviations from good clinical practices at study sites of the initial Phase 3 trial. The company submitted in late June an amended NDA, and in late July, it said the regulatory agency had deemed its submission as a complete, class 2 response. \"Management noted that the questions received from FDA so far have been reasonable and confirmatory in nature, and that it feels very good about its answers to the agency's information requests,\" SVB Leerink analyst Ami Fadia said in a recent note. \"All in all, it clearly sees great potential in arbaclofen, but is cautiously optimistic on the approval given the history of the product.\" Company:  Scpharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ: SCPH)\nType of Application:  NDA\nCandidate:  Furoscix\nIndication:  worsening heart failure due to congestion\nDate:  Dec. 30 Furoscix is a proprietary, subcutaneously-delivered furosemide solution, as an outpatient alternative for the treatment of worsening congestive\u00a0heart failure. This is scPharma's second try for Furoscix following a CRL issued in 2018, wherein the agency sought additional human factor\u00a0studies, device modifications\u00a0and potentially a clinical validation study. The PDUFA event is a significant catalyst for the stock, SVB Leerink analyst Fadia said. The analyst said she is cautiously optimistic on the approval, given the regulatory history, and put an 80% probability of success on approval. If approved, the analyst models a price target for $20 for the shares. Company:  Athenex Inc (NASDAQ: ATNX)\nType of Application:  NDA\nCandidate:  tirbanibulin ointment\nIndication:  actinic keratosis\nDate:  Dec. 30 The NDA for tirbanibulin ointment was accepted for review March 9. Athenex has granted Almirall, S.A., an exclusive license for R&D and commercializing tirbanibulin ointment in the U.S. and European countries, including Russia. Actinic Keratosis is the most common pre-cancerous condition in dermatology and affects more than 55 million Americans, and accounts for between 14-29% of dermatologist visits in the U.S., Athenex said. Company:  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ: VRTX)\nType of Application:  sNDAs\nCandidate:  Trikafta (elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor), Symdeko (tezacaftor and ivacaftor) and Kalydeco (ivacaftor)\nIndication:  cystic fibrosis\nDate:  Dec. 30 The sNDAs were accepted by the FDA for review Sept. 1. These regulatory submissions are intended to expand the labels for Trikafta, Symdeko and Kalydeco to include additional rare CFTR mutations, Vertex said. Potential approvals will also allow certain people with cystic fibrosis, who are currently eligible for Kalydeco to become eligible for Symdeko or Trikafta and certain people currently eligible for Symdeko tp become eligible for Trikafta, it added. The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, or VRBPAC, will meet Dec. 10, in an open session to discuss emergency use authorization of the vaccine candidate developed by Pfizer-BioNTech SE \u2013 ADR (NASDAQ: BNTX) for the prevention of COVID-19 in individuals 16 years of age and older. The companies  filed with the FDA an application for EUA  Nov. 20. Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA) is also likely to meet with VRBPAC once it mandated safety data is accrued and it files for EUA.

Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21201.\t\t Source: Shutterstock Before the novel coronavirus pandemic, it took an average of 4 years and more than $2 billion to get a drug through FDA safety and efficacy trials. That\u2019s why many scientists and industry observers are so impressed (and concerned) with the speed that vaccine trials for COVID-19 have progressed. And that\u2019s why biotech stocks have been such a popular topic of discussion. Additionally, as we\u2019ve seen with AstraZeneca\u2019s (NYSE:AZN) drug, even promising drugs far down the pipeline can get caught up during trials. That\u2019s why the trials are so thorough and require large amounts of testing. The current system evolved after a polio vaccine was distributed in the heat of the polio epidemic in the U.S. in 1955. It was faulty, and of the initial 200,000 children given the vaccine, 40,000 got polio, and 10 died. That said, the speed of the current COVID-19 vaccine is a bit different in that there have already been years of work done on SARS-type viruses, of which COVID-19 is an adaptation. And as we learn about the virus, technology is much faster finding solutions. Overall, this is all to the benefit of the next generation of drugs and drug therapies. And the seven \u201cA-rated\u201d aggressive biotech stocks I discuss here get the highest marks from my Portfolio Grader. These companies are all making important strides in next-gen solutions for COVID-19, cancer and other sectors. But remember, they\u2019re small companies in a risky space, nibble on them and be patient. With that in mind, could these investments be a \u201cMaster Key\u201d investment? Well, before I get into each one, what exactly do I mean by that? What is a Master Key investment? You see, in the literal sense a Master Key is a single key that can be used to unlock any door in a building, even though each door has its own individual key. In short, whoever holds this Master Key has the power to unlock any door \u2014 and that\u2019s exactly the kind of investment opportunity we look for. That said, I have a decent idea of some Master Key picks for big gains, and you can get on board right here. Now, here are the handful of biotech stocks were looking at: ChemoCentryx (NASDAQ:CCXI) Adaptimmune Therapeutics (NASDAQ:ADAP) Sorrento Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SRNE) Myovant Sciences (NYSE:MYOV) Seres Therapeutics (NASDAQ:MCRB) Kodiak Sciences (NASDAQ:KOD) Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) Let\u2019s take a closer look at each one.   This Silicon Valley-based drug company is at the heart of tech world, so it\u2019s no surprise that it is developing innovative solutions to autoimmune diseases, inflammatory disorders and cancer. It has nine drugs in various stages of drug trials, and focuses on orphan and rare diseases. Its unique approach is to use two specific receptors in molecules to target their responses to particular diseases. In that way, it allows the rest of the body\u2019s immune system to help resist the invader. One of its drugs for vasculitis, Avacopan, is through trials and has applied for an NDA (new drug application). In turn, it could be in the market this year. Overall, CCXI stock stock is up nearly 600% in the past year due to the good news on Avacopan. However, it has plenty more on their way. And if the approval comes through, it could mean big things for ChemoCentryx and CCXI stock.   This is another clinical stage biotech, with three immune oncology drugs in trials right now. ADAP focuses on using the body\u2019s immune system soldiers, the T cells, to fight solid tumors that are generated by a number of different types of cancer. As with many newer biotechs, advancements in technology have allowed scientists to learn much more about how cancers fool the immune system into allowing them grow relatively undetected. By triggering different responses from different parts of the cell, in this case helping T cells recognize the cancer, immune oncology drugs may be the new way to treat cancer without massive doses of chemicals. Moreover, ADAP stock is one of the companies leading this charge. And you can see it in the stock price. In fact, ADAP stock is up more than 600% year-to-date due to some of its breakthroughs. But it still only has a market capitalization of $1.33 billion. So while it will be volatile, it\u2019s very promising \u2014 just like my Master Key\u00a0investments that you can get in on right now.   This company landed in the headlines this week when it announced that it received FDA approval for a phase 1 clinical trial for its COVI-GUARD antibody testing for COVID-19. In turn, it hopes to get emergency use authorization for the test by late this year or early next year. Sorrento Therapeutics focuses on immuno-oncology drugs and a proprietary device \u2014 Sofusa \u2014 that delivers antibodies to the lymphatic system to \u201ctrain\u201d immune cells to fight cancer. Obviously, the COVID-19 testing news has created a stir, but its library of antibodies and work in immuno-oncology is the bedrock of its business. However, selling millions of tests would certainly help fund its larger efforts. Right now, it has a more than a dozen drugs in trials, including some COVID-19 vaccines. Collectively, SRNE stock is up 317% in the past 12 months and 182% year to date \u2014 making it one of the best biotech stocks out there.   This UK-based biotech has only been around since 2016, but it has been hard at work. The company currently has a drug candidate, Relugolix, that is in 5 international phase 3 trials for fibroids, endometriosis pain and advanced prostate cancer. That\u2019s quite a promising start for Myovant. And while its markets aren\u2019t cancer or some rare disease where prices can be set at premiums, these drugs could have a huge audience. That said, getting a drug through the pipeline and into the market means cash flow, which is the ultimate goal of all clinical biotechs. And doing it quickly is very good for investors. Overall, the stock has a $2 billion market cap after a 274% run in the past 12 months. And two of its drugs are about to hit the market. Therefore, MYOV stock is another great option among biotech stocks. And if you\u2019re looking for other great investment opportunities, check out my\u00a0Master Key\u00a0portfolio.   A couple decades ago, there was a new field of research into what was called the microbiome. Basically, this is the world or organisms and bacteria that live in or on our bodies. Research was beginning to reveal that just like nature keeps a balancing act among its creatures, so do our bodies. One bacteria gets too powerful due to disease or nutrition, and there\u2019s a reaction. Decades later, Seres Therapeutics has built its clinical stage biotech on developing drugs that work with the gut biome. It currently has six drugs in various stages of development with support from significant partners. The drugs range from combating Clostridium difficile \u2014 or C diff \u2014 and colitis to metastatic melanoma. C diff is the leading cause of hospital-caused infection in the U.S., and is responsible for 20,000 deaths a year. Collectively, MCRB stock is up 452% in the past three months due to the good news on its phase 3 trials. It also has nearly a $2.4 billion market cap, and its unique approach to drug development makes it an attractive takeover target as well. Thus, Seres Therapeutics makes for another great option among biotech stocks.   This biotech solely focuses on novel therapies for retinal diseases. While younger demographics may not understand the significance of this sector, macular degeneration (aka, going blind) becomes a real issue as people get older. And now that people are living longer, sight loss affects an even greater number of people. With that in mind, Kodiak Sciences currently has six drugs in trial stages, and most are in phases 2 and 3. There is big demand for these chronic and debilitating conditions, and Kodiak\u2019s unique intravitreal biopolymer conjugates have been very effective in trials so far. Overall, KOD stock is up 212% in the past year, but it\u2019s down almost 28% year to date, likely as more attention has gone into COVID-19 vaccine and testing candidates. That said, KOD stock \u2014 like my\u00a0Master Key\u00a0investment opportunities \u2014 is a great option.   While NVAX stock is now in the news due to its COVID-19 vaccine trial,\u00a0 its recent deal with an Indian pharmaceutical company to be able to produce 2 billion vaccines by early next year has also been huge. The company\u2019s potential vaccine is just wrapping up phase 2 drug trials, and will be starting phase 3 imminently. All this news has driven the stock through the roof in 2020. In fact, it\u2019s up 2,700% year to date. And it now sports a market cap of nearly $7 billion, which is pretty rich for company that doesn\u2019t have a drug out of clinical trials yet. Overall, NanoFlu is really the hidden gem in its portfolio. The flu vaccine is in phase 3 trials, and has proven to be more effective than the current leading flu vaccine on the market. This would deliver some significant revenue on a regular basis and help fund the rest of the company\u2019s ambitions. It\u2019s certainly trading at a COVID-19 premium, but it has some solid fundamentals beyond that horse race. As I mentioned at the beginning of this article, I told you a little bit about what Master Key investments are and what they could mean. That said, these investments are by far the best and most lucrative you can make. However, that can only happen if you get in on them early. For example, our research firm has a remarkable track record for identifying and giving our readers the chance to get in on the ground floor of some of the most innovative, most disruptive companies of the past half century. This includes businesses like Intel, Amazon, Priceline, and Netflix. But what I haven\u2019t told you yet is that all of these world-changing companies have one thing common: They\u2019re what our network of financial insiders refer to as Master Key investments. Therefore, right now, you have the opportunity to get in on this \u2014 but only if you act fast. So, don\u2019t waste another second and see what Master Key investment opportunities look like.
